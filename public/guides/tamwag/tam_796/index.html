    <p>Conrad Woelfel (1902-1989) was a German American labor leader and fraternal organizer based in Detroit and New York City. Woelfel was born in Nuremberg, Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1923. He held various labor-related positions during his life: President of Engravers Lodge 2136; an Executive Board member of District 15, Machinists Union; and for 20 years, an organizer and Secretary-Treasurer of the International Metal Engravers Union. Woelfel was also deeply engaged in the German American community, co-founding the German-American Congress for Democracy (an organization for which he served as National Secretary). He held the position of President of the Workmen's Benefit Fund for 20 years, until his retirement in 1976. The Conrad Woelfel Papers (dated 1924-2008) includes scrapbooks, correspondence, newspaper articles, and photographs documenting Woelfel's labor union organizing in New York City from the 1930s through the 1970s, particularly his tenure as President of the Workman's Benefit Fund; and his engagement with the German American community, with an emphasis on his involvement with the German-American Congress for Democracy. The collection documents 20th century labor organizing, particularly in the greater New York City area and with an emphasis on the experiences of German and Jewish immigrants. The collection also shows the ways in which German immigrants navigated concepts of American patriotism during World War II, and how they built solidarity, community, and support for one another. The collection also contains a small amount of materials documenting the Recreation Farm Society collected by Woelfel's daughter Helen Krumpf, including financial records and photographic prints.</p></div>
