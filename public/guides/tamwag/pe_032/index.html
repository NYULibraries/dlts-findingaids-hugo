  <div>
      <p> The Socialist Party of America was established on 29 July 1901 as a result of a merger between the moderate wing of the Socialist Labor Party and the Social Democratic Party. For most of its turbulent history, the Socialist Party has been reformist in its political attitudes and democratic in its organization. Until the mid 1950s, the Socialist Party advocated trade unionism, supported an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary conversion to socialism, and endorsed progressive as well as socialist candidates for public office. </p><p> 
Between 1901 and 1912, the party's membership grew from 10,000 to 118,000 and the votes cast for socialist Presidential candidates increased proportionately from 100,000 to 900,000. By advocating reform of the political and economic system, the party was able to enlist the support of many orthodox socialists and many heterogeneous elements remaining from such progressive movements as the Greenbackers, Populists, and "Single Taxers". The result was a broad based party, particularly strong in the West, which was prepared to sacrifice ideological purity for numbers and revolutionary gains for immediate political success. Evidence of this policy was demonstrated in the fact that in 1912 there were 56 socialist mayors, over 300 socialist aldermen, many socialist state legislators, and one socialist member of the House of Representatives. </p><p> This success, however, was short lived. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, the Socialist Party suffered from the same external pressures which caused other progressive movements to stagnate. The party also suffered from numerous internal crises as well, including the expulsion of its revolutionary wing in 1912 1913; the party's official opposition to World War I, and the Russian Revolution of 1917, which encouraged the left wing of the party to demand a more militant program and, when this was not forthcoming, to secede from the party in 1919 and establish the Communist Party. </p><p> Following a brief resurgence in the late 1920s and early 1930s under the strong leadership of Norman Thomas, the Socialist Party was once again plagued with internal conflicts. The principal divisions within the party at this time were generational, geographical, and ideological in nature.  </p><p> These three factions did not bring their differences of opinion into public focus until the 1932 Socialist Party convention in Milwaukee. The conflict intensified during the New York City fur workers dispute in 1933. In the fur industry of New York City there were two rival unions, one controlled by the Socialist Party Old Guard and the other led by the Communist Party. During the dispute over which union should represent all of the fur workers, the Militants charged that the Old Guard was attempting to subvert the communist union in its quest for total control despite the fact that most of the workers supported the communists. Norman Thomas concurred in this view and demanded that the Old Guard cease its activities against the communist union members. The Old Guard union responded to these charges by obtaining a labor injunction against the communist union. Eventually, the fur workers dispute was resolved when members of both unions negotiated a settlement. </p><p> Another incident which pitted the three factions against each other occurred during the debate on the Declaration of Principles at the 1934 Socialist Party convention in Detroit. The Declaration of Principles was drafted by the Progressives and the Militants and included numerous statements on issues which they believed every socialist should advocate. When the delegates finally adopted the Declaration of Principles before the convention adjourned, it clearly demonstrated that the Old Guard was gradually losing control of the party. </p><p> The factional strife came to a climax in 1936 when the Old Guard bolted from the Socialist Party after the national convention in Cleveland and organized the Social Democratic Federation. The withdrawal of the Old Guard was a serious loss for the party. Not only did major socialist figures from New York, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania leave the party, but they took with them much of the financial support of the party as well. In addition to these developments, two major urban political machines in the Socialist Party Reading, Pennsylvania and Bridgeport, Connecticut joined the Social Democratic Federation. </p><p> Following the departure of the old Guard, the Progressives and militants continued the party's infighting by dividing into three groups. The first group was an amalgamation of the old Progressives and the leadership of the Militants. Under the direction of Jack Altman and Paul Porter these moderates supported the American Labor Party and endorsed a more democratic view of socialism. A second group, formerly associated with the Militants, were emerging as the new left wing faction of the party. Calling itself the "Clarity" group after the periodical, Socialist Clarity, this group was led by Frank Trager, Gus Tyler, Robert and Max Delson, and Herbert Zam. Ideologically, the Clarity group was not opposed to labor parties and farm labor coalitions, but they were more insistent than the Altman group that any labor party wanting Socialist Party support should have a wide labor base and should repudiate capitalist reformist politics. </p><p> Complicating the situation within the party was an ultra left Trotskyite faction. Known as the Appeal group because of their periodical, Socialist Appeal, the Trotskyites maintained that the Socialist Party should repudiate all labor and farmer labor parties and thus transform itself into a revolutionary party.  </p><p> These three factions clashed on a variety of issues during the late 1930s. In national convention sessions and local political campaigns, these groups differed over the Socialist Party's attitude toward preventing war, the Socialist Party's affiliation with the American League Against War and Fascism, and socialist cooperation with organized labor. By the end of 1937, the disputes between the various groups were so damaging to the conduct of party business that the National Executive Committee finally took decisive action and expelled the Trotskyite faction. </p><p> The Socialist Party never fully recovered from these setbacks, although negotiations were successful in reuniting the Social Democratic Federation with the party in 1957. Nevertheless, despite this encouraging development, the internal conflicts and the emergence of the New Left in the late 1950s and 1960s eventually caused the Socialist Party to lose its influence as an effective political organization. </p>

  <div>
      <p> This artifical collection, created over the years by staff of Tamiment via donations, personal collectiong and materials removed from other collections, consists of memoranda, correspondence, constitutions, fliers, leaflets, newspaper clippings, and pamphlets. The collection offers a general feel for the types of printed matter put out by the Party as well as a brief introduction to and history of the Party and how it changed over the years.  Represented in the collection are the Sociality Party of America (Socialist Party (U.S.), the later Socialist Party U.S.A., the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) and a few other related organizations. </p><p> The bulk of the collection consists of papers, fliers, pamphlets and other party material from the Socialist Party of America headquartered in Chicago.  Another significant portion of the collection comes from the Socialist Party of New York City.  Also included are materials from Young People's Socialist Party (YPSL), an organization of young socialists.  There are election campaign handbooks from the National Headquarters as well as some state and county affiliates. The Party went through several splits and in 1973, the Socialist Party of the USA was formed, which is the organization today. </p><p> Some of the oldest items in the collection come from individual states party papers, such as Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  The Young People's Socialist League contains significant information on the conventions, education and communications in this group.  </p><p> A ledger added to collection in 2018 documents membership dues and contributions from the Socialist Party of America's local division in Granite Falls, Washington. The ledger contains a short index followed by numerous pages filled with members' names and other details; each entry displays information pertaining to their occupation, age, date of admittance and payment records. Notable names in the ledger include E.E. Martin and R. Krueger, secretaries of state for the Socialist party in 1905 and 1907, respectively, as well as prominent Socialist party member and anti-war activist Emil Herman, who is listed in the ledger as a speaker on 27 January 1908. Entries range from 1901 to 1913. </p>
