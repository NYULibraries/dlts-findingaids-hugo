    <p>Charles A. Laverty (1930-2015) was a journalist and historian who was active in Irish republican organizations.  His research interests included the participation of the Irish in American wars, particularly the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.  He was a founding member of the Irish Brigade Association, an organization devoted to the history of the United States Army 69th Infantry Regiment, an historically Irish regiment created in 1849.   The Charles Laverty Papers date from 1767 to 2015, with the bulk of the material dating between 1960 and 2010.  The collection documents Laverty's research interests, his working life, his participation in Irish republican organizations, his family history, and his membership in historical organizations.  The bulk of the collection consists of Laverty's research files on Irish soldiers in American wars, members of the United Irishmen and the Fenian Brotherhood who emigrated to the United States, and members of religious orders who served as medical personnel on battlefields.  The collection also contains correspondence, clippings, photographs, paper and born-digital administrative documents, publications of Irish historical and republican organizations with which Laverty was associated, and a video recording of members of the Irish Brigade Association.  Laverty's work as a journalist is documented mainly through his publication <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Automotive Week</span>, a weekly newsletter on the automobile aftermarket.  The collection also includes the papers of William V. Kennedy, an author and historian with an interest in the American Civil War.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Charles A. Laverty (1930-2015) was a journalist and historian who was active in Irish republican organizations.  His research interests included the participation of the Irish in American wars, particularly the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.  He was a founding member of the Irish Brigade Association, an organization devoted to the history of the United States Army 69th Infantry Regiment, an historically Irish regiment created in 1849.  Laverty was born in Moy, County Tyrone, Ireland in 1930 and immigrated to the United States in 1948.  He worked in journalism and in the publishing industry for over 50 years, writing for the New York Journal-American and working as an editor for automotive magazines and for the Department of Defense before acquiring and publishing the newsletter <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Automotive Week</span> between 1975 and 2000s.  He served in the United States Army between 1951 and 1953 and was a member of the Army Reserves's Special Forces from 1957 to 1970.  Laverty served as the national secretary for Clan na Gael in the 1960s, the chairman of the Irish Brigade Committee in the 1960s and 1970s, and president of the New York Irish History Roundtable in the early 2000s.  He was an active member of a number of other Irish-American history organizations and Irish political organizations. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The Charles Laverty Papers date from 1767 to 2015, with the bulk of the material dating between 1960 and 2010.  The collection documents Laverty's research interests, his working life, his participation in Irish republican organizations, his family history, and his membership in historical organizations.  The bulk of the collection consists of Laverty's research files on Irish soldiers in American wars, members of the United Irishmen and the Fenian Brotherhood who emigrated to the United States, and members of religious orders who served as medical personnel on battlefields.  The research files contain photocopies from 19th and 20th century books, periodicals, and maps, as well as photographs, correspondence, pamphlets, and notes collected and created by Laverty.  He used these files to create a website containing biographies of Irish people who settled in the American colonies and the United States between the 17th century through the 19th century.  Laverty's membership in the Irish Brigade Association and the New York Irish History Roundtable is well documented in this collection through correspondence with members, paper and born-digital business records, clippings and photographs documenting activities of both organizations, and publications of both organizations.  Laverty's work as a journalist is documented mainly through his publication <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Automotive Week</span>, a weekly newsletter on the automobile aftermarket, with a small amount of material documenting his work at McGraw-Hill in the 1950s.  The collection includes correspondence between Laverty and his family, photographs of his parents and siblings, and clippings about his family's horse breeding business and his brother's soccer career.  Laverty's interest and participation in Irish republican organizations is documented through letters to Laverty from Brian O'Higgins, founding member and president of Sinn Féin; correspondence, publications, and administrative documents from Laverty's participation in Clan na Gael, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, and Irish Prisoners Aid Committee.  The collection also includes the papers of William V. Kennedy, an author and historian with an interest in the American Civil War.  These include articles by Kennedy on the military and Catholicism, his work with the Thompson Battalion Memorial Project Committee, his military career, and his lawsuits brought against the Army War College. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Series were created according to six broad topics extant in the collection: Laverty's family life, his career, his interests in Irish and Irish American history and Irish republican politics, his activity in organizations related to these topics, and the William V. Kennedy Papers.  The majority of these materials were not housed in folders and were mixed together with unrelated material.  During the initial survey of the collection in 2018, roughly 50% of the collection was non-archival material with little value, including photocopies from secondary sources and printouts of internet searches.  These materials were identified for deaccessioning.  During the survey, material in each box was identified as belonging to a particular series.  The collection was processed by an archivist between October 2019 and February 2020.  During this time, materials selected for deaccessioning were removed from the collection and materials for each series were brought together physically and housed in archival folders and boxes. </p><p> Floppy disks and optical media were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. </p><p> New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.  </p>

      <p> Donated by Charles Laverty, 2015.  In 2011, Laverty was hospitalized and his papers were moved, without his supervision, from his office.  In 2014, the collection was partly housed in a storage facility and in Laverty's room at a senior living facility, both in New Jersey.  Prior to and following Laverty's death in October 2015, the collection was transferred to New York University in January, April, and October of 2015.  It is not known who packed the collection prior to its transfer to NYU. </p>
