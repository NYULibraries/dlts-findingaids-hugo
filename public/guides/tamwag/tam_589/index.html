    <p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) is a non-profit legal advocacy organization based in New York City.

This unprocessed collection of records created or collected by CCR consists of correspondence, political ephemera, newspaper clippings, websites, research files, and legal documents, including briefs, motions, and trial transcripts documenting the organization's legal advocacy.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) is a non-profit legal advocacy organization based on New York City. It was founded in 1966 by civil rights lawyers and legal activists, including William Kuntsler, Morton Stavis, Arthur Kinoy, and Ben Smith. The Center was initially established to provide legal services and financial support to lawyers representing civil rights movement activists in Mississippi. Since then, CCR has broadened its focus to civil liberties and human rights activism and litigation more generally, providing legal assistance to a variety of clients, including Guantanamo Bay detainment camp prisoners and victims of racial profiling in the wake of 9/11. </p>
