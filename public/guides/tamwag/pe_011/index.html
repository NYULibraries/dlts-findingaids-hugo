    <p>The Printed Ephemera Collection on the United Steelworkers of America is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades. The United Steelworkers of America was founded in 1942 and through mergers with other unions has become one of largest industrial unions in North America. Ranging in date from the 1940s through the 1990s, the collection consists primarily of agreements, contracts and constitutions, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications. The material in the collection was generated by the national and international bodies of the United Steelworkers of America, various Districts and Locals, as well as rank and file committees.

      <p> In 1936, John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, named Philip Murray chairman of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC). The Committee was charged with leading an organizing drive of the entire steel industry. Out of the SWOC, the United Steelworkers of America was formed, holding its founding convention in 1942. Murray was elected as the first president and served until his death in 1952. Since its founding, various unions have merged with the United Steelworkers, most recently, in 2005, the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers (PACE) International Union. This merger created the largest industrial union in North America, a union not only of steelworkers but also workers in industries such as manufacturing, health care, pharmaceuticals, mining, energy and utilities. As of 2009, the United Steelworkers of American had over 850,000 active members in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. </p>

      <p> Founded in 1942, the United Steelworkers of America is today one of the largest industrial unions in North America, representing workers in the steel industry as well as the paper, chemical, service, health care, energy and utility industries. The United Steelworkers of America Printed Ephemera Collection ranges in date from the 1940s through the 1990s and consists of agreements, contracts, and constitutions, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications. There are several publications related to the National War Labor Board (1944) as well as publications relating to national wage stabilization and wage policy in the steel industry, dating from the late 1940s through the 1950s. In addition to material generated by the national and international bodies of the United Steelworkers of America, the collection also contains constitutions, fliers, and publications from various districts, locals, and rank and file committees.
