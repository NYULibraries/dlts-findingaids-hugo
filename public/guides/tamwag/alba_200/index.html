  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> George Chaikin (whose Communist Party name was George Auvan) was born in 1908 and raised in New York City. While at Princeton University, he was active in a movement to integrate movie theaters in Trenton and Princeton, New Jersey. He graduated from Princeton University in 1931. A mechanical engineer, Chaikin worked for the Works Progress Administration and taught at the Harlem Workers School. Active in politics, Chaikin was National Financial Secretary of the Young Communist League. He participated in numerous strikes and demonstrations, and spent ten days in the Tombs prison in New York City, accused of attacking a policeman during a march. </p><p> Chaikin sailed for Europe on the S.S. Washington, arriving in Spain in March 1937 to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Chaikin applied his language facility (he spoke French, German, and Yiddish) and his engineering skills in the motor pools of the International and Spanish Brigades. He also worked for a medical unit. On his one visit to the front lines, Chaikin was wounded and partially crippled in the arm. While recovering in the hospital, he organized efforts to aid Spanish orphans. He left Spain when the International Brigades were evacuated from the country, sailing home on the S.S. Harding in late December 1938. </p><p> Chaikin's Spanish Civil War injury prevented him from active duty in World War II. Instead he worked for the United States defense industry as an engineer. His political activism during the McCarthy era brought upon Chaikin unwanted attentions from the U.S. government, severely damaging his career. </p><p> Chaikin and his wife, Elizabeth, had two sons, one of whom was mayor of Point Arena, California, and a daughter. Chaikin died in 1992. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I: Spanish Civil War Materials</span>consists of documents relating to Chaikin's activity as an organizer of aid to Spanish orphans during and following the Spanish Civil War, including a 1937 drawing by a Spanish child, as well as children's statements on war. Correspondence is comprised of letters written to Chaikin in Spanish from people he had known in Spain. One letter, written to Chaikin after he had returned to the U.S. (and translated into English beneath each line), is from a woman in a concentration camp expressing her hope of soon being evacuated to England. Also included are official military documents and artifacts, graphic and print propaganda, and a Certificate of Combat. Ephemera includes a tag from Chaikin's return trip from Spain on the S.S. Harding; a map of Madrid; a program from a concert given by the Pioners de Catalunya for the International Brigades; a 1937-1938 calendar of the Comunidad Israelita de Barcelona (in Yiddish and Spanish) and a flyer distributed by the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade instructing fundraisers on how to conduct street collections. Many of the materials in the collection are in Spanish. Others are in French. </p>
