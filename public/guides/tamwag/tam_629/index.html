    <p>Asia Pacific Forum (APF), founded by a collective of journalists and political activists, is a weekly pan-Asian radio show based in New York City that began in broadcasting 1998 on 99.5 WBAI, a non-commercial and listener-sponsored radio station.  The program covers stories from Asia and on Asian American communities and individuals, focusing on culture and politics.  Its records document approximately 500 of APF's on-air shows between 1998-2009, in scripts, research notes, electronic records of e-mail messages posted to the APF's internal listserv and public e-mail list, audio cassette tapes, reel-to-reel audio tapes, compact discs, mini-discs, VHS tapes and DVDs.  Among the audio recordings are airchecks for some of the shows, as well as full-length unedited recorded interviews with notable Asian Americans.  An archived link to APF's website provides a connection to complete APF broadcasts from August 2006 forward.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Asia Pacific Forum (APF) is a weekly pan-Asian radio show based in New York City that broadcasts on WBAI 99.5 and streams live on the Internet.  Focusing on culture and politics, APF's broadcasts cover underreported stories from Asia and on Asian American communities and individuals, exploring topics including social and political movements, civil and human rights, foreign policy, immigration, history, labor, literature, pop culture, and the performing arts.  WBAI is part of the Pacifica Foundation, a non-commercial and listener-sponsored national radio network. </p><p> APF was founded in 1998, when Samori Marksman, program director of WBAI, and Sybil Wong, former business director of WBAI, brought together a group of journalists and progressive political activists to organize a weekly program focused on New York's Asian communities.  Founding members included Kil Huh, John Kim, Jungwon Kim, Suen-yi Meng, and Doualy Xaykaotao.  APF was organized as a collective and has continued to operate as one. A formal application process to join the collective was instituted in 2005.  As of 2011, core collective members included Amna Akbar, Vivek Bharathan, Michelle Chen, Andrew Hsiao, Hyun Lee, Leyla Mei, Dorian Merina, Silky Shah, Naureen Shah, and Irene Tung.  </p><p> Soon after the founding of APF, the show began a partnership with <span class="ead-title">SAMAR</span> magazine, the<span class="ead-title">South Asian Magazine for Action and Reflection</span>, a New York-based publication that explores the politics and culture of South Asia and the South Asian diaspora. During this time, members of the SAMAR collective, including Ananya Bhattacharjee, Aniruddha Das, Satinder Jawanda, Chandana Mathur, S. Shankar, and others, produced and hosted one show per month. The arrangement ended in 2001, when several SAMAR members joined the APF collective. APF quickly expanded its coverage to encompass East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific as well as Asian America. </p><p> The show's content is local, national, and international in scope. Among the Asian and Asian American newsmakers that have been featured on APF are Arundhati Roy, Tariq Ali, David Henry Hwang, Monique Truong, Edward Said, Maxine Hong Kingston, Vijay Prashad, Cathi Tactaquin, Grace Lee Boggs, Bhairavi Desai, Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Margaret Fung, Mike Honda, John Liu, Stacey Ann Chin, Jeff Chang, and DJ Rekha. In 2006, APF began podcasting and making its weekly broadcasts available as downloads on the Web, allowing the show to reach a broader audience both nationally and globally. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Asia Pacific Forum Records document approximately 500 of APF's on-air shows from 1998-2009, including scripts (some annotated with hand-written notes), preparatory materials, and research notes for shows (including biographies of guests and background articles), along with some documentation of APF's publicity efforts. In addition there are electronic records (mainly stored on compact discs) consisting of e-mail messages posted to the collective's internal listserv and discussion board, as well as its public e-mail list. A significant portion of the records also include audio cassette tapes, compact discs, mini-discs, and reel-to-reel audio tapes. Some of these materials contain airchecks (complete recordings of APF's live broadcasts, recorded in the studio by the host(s) of these shows). Of particular significance among the collection's audio recordings are full-length unedited recorded interviews with notable Asian Americans including activist Yuri Kochiyama, novelist Jessica Hagedorn, and musician and activist Chris Iijima. A small part of the records consist of VHS tapes and DVDs sent to APF by outside producers or distributors for promotional purposes or for consideration for possible inclusion in its programs.  In addition, an archived link to APF's website makes it possible to directly listen to APF broadcasts from August 2006 forward.  The collection does not contain a complete set of recordings of all of APF's shows, nor does it include a comprehensive list of all of APF's broadcasts (at present no such document exists) or any transcripts for the shows. </p>
