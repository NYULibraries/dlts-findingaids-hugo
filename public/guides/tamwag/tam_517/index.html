    <p>Philip Burnett Franklin Agee (1935–2008) was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer and writer, best known as the author of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Inside the Company: CIA Diary</span> (1975), which identifed about 250 CIA officers, front companies and foreign agents then or previously working for the United States. Agee joined the CIA in 1957, and over the following decade had postings in Washington, D.C., Ecuador, Uruguay, and Mexico. After resigning from the Agency in 1968, he became a leading opponent of CIA practices. Exiled from the U.S., and expelled from Great Britain, he died in Cuba in January 2008. The collection contains: biographical materials, correspondence, datebooks, documents obtained under the FOIA Act, notably CIA documents, as well as FBI and State Department documents; legal materials from various cases in which Agee was the plaintiff; lectures and university teaching files; subject files, many relating to Latin American and other countries and to CIA activity in them, and some relating to his expulsion from Great Britain; published and unpublished writings by Agee; reviews of his work; and other writings about Agee.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Philip Burnett Franklin Agee (July 19, 1935–January 7, 2008) was a United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer and writer. He is best known as the author of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Inside the Company: CIA Diary</span> (1975), first published in Britain because of legal problems in the U.S., which identifed about 250 officers, front companies and foreign agents working for or cooperating with the United States. Agee joined the CIA in 1957, and over the following decade had postings in Washington, D.C., Ecuador, Uruguay, and Mexico. After resigning from the Agency in 1968, he became a leading opponent of CIA practices. Agee also wrote <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe</span> (1978), <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Dirty Work: The CIA in Africa</span> (1979), and a biography, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">On the Run</span> (1987). Agee's work inspired the founding of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Covert Action Information Bulletin</span>, for which he also wrote.  He was exiled from the U.S., for revealing classified information, via the revocation of his passport by the U.S. Department of State in 1979 while he was abroad (upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1989). He was also pressured to leave Great Britain in 1977. He lectured throughout Western and Eastern Europe. Agee was also eventually expelled from Holland, France, West Germany, and Italy, and died in Cuba in January, 2008. </p><p> Agee was involved in several legal cases. Agee sued the United States Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, Department of State, and Department of Justice, seeking to obtain government documents under the Freedom of Information Act, and obtained numerous documents as a result of these complex legal proceedings that related to his former CIA employment, and to his investigative and writing activities. Agee also sued Barbara Bush,alleging that, in her <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Barbara Bush: Memoir</span> (Scribner, 1994) she had falsely held him responsible for the death of Athens CIA Station Chief Richard Welch, assassinated in 1975. Agee also sued George Crile, Gust Avrakotos, Grove/Atlantic, the Atlantic Monthly Press, and Publishers Group West, claiming that Crile's book <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Charlie Wilson's War</span> (Grove/Atlantic, 2003) falsely held him responsible for the death of Richard Welch.  </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The collection contains: biographical materials, photographs, correspondence, detailed datebooks; (U.S.) government documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) -- principally CIA documents, as well as FBI and State Department documents; legal materials from various cases in which Agee was the plaintiff; lectures and university teaching files in both paper and electronic format; subject files, many relating to Latin American and other countries and to the CIA's activities in relation to them, and some relating to his expulsion from Great Britain; writings by and about Agee; with clippings and clippings files throughout. The leading correspondent is Agee's attorney, Meliv L. Wulf; there is also correspondence with several publishers, with Noam Chomsky, Maurice Bishop, (revolutionary Prime Minister of Grenada from 1979-1983), Ilona Maria Lorenz (Fidel Castro's onetime lover, later hired by CIA to assassinate Castro), and publisher Lyle Stuart. The collection, in addition to documenting Agee's life, his career as a CIA agent and his subsequent activities to expose and oppose U.S. foreign intelligence activities and foreign policy goals, and legal cases in which he was involved, will also be of interest to the study of U.S. foreign intelligence activities and foreign policy, notably in relation to Latin America but also in Western Europe and elsewhere. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The order of the series, and their contents was for the most part imposed on the loosely or apparently unorganized original materials. </p><p> Photographs were separated from this collection during initial processing and were established as a separate collection, the Phillip Agee Photographs (PHOTOS 284). In 2014, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the Phillip Agee Papers. </p><p> Floppy disks were forensically imaged and analyzed. Microsoft Word documents from these images were migrated to .pdf format for access, and Apache OpenOffice .odt files were created for preservation. </p>
