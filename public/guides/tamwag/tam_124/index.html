    <p>Sam Adams Darcy (1905-2005), born Samuel Dardeck in the Ukraine of Jewish background, was an organizer, orator, writer, a leading official of the CPUSA and an official in the Communist International. Darcy helped organize the first mass demonstration of unemployed in New York City, was chairperson of the Communist Party California during the 1934 San Francisco General Strike, and made an unsuccessful run for governor of California in 1934. In 1941, Darcy was imprisoned briefly for allegedly falsifying information on his voter registration form. He left the CPUSA in 1945.

The papers contain correspondence, writings (unpublished and published), CPUSA internal documents, clippings, ephemera, photographs, and an oral history transcript. Best documented are Darcy's educational, electoral and labor activity, and intra-Party relationships and struggles.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Sam Adams Darcy (1905-2005), born Samuel Dardeck in the Ukraine of Jewish background was a leading official of the CPUSA for some twenty years (1925-44), and also held a number of important positions in the Communist International. Darcy was an effective organizer, talented public speaker and a prolific and vivid writer with a flair for dramatization. From 1925-27 he was head of the Party's youth organization, the Young Workers League. Along with William Z. Foster, his friend and ally in intra-party struggle against CP head Earl Browder, he organized in New York City in March 1930 the first mass unemployed demonstration. </p><p> From 1931-36 Darcy headed the second largest Party district, California, where he personally participated in the organizing of agricultural workers and the related successful struggle against California's criminal syndicalism law. As head of the California Party organization, he also played a leading role in the longshore and San Francisco general strike of 1934. That year Darcy was the Party's gubernatorial candidate, after unsuccessfully arguing within the party's central committee for a united front with Upton Sinclair's EPIC (End Poverty in California) movement. </p><p> Darcy's visibility in California was a factor in his becoming one of several Party leaders who faced legal action after the Russo-German treaty of 1939 placed the CPUSA in sharp opposition to American foreign policy. In September 1940 Darcy was indicted on charges of perjury for allegedly having incorrectly stated his name and birthplace in registering to vote in California in 1934, and spent six weeks in jail, until September 1941. </p><p> From 1939-44 Darcy led the Party's fourth largest district, Eastern Pennsylvania, and was heavily involved in electoral work, notably the Party's campaign to defeat the 1943 Democratic nominee for mayor of Philadelphia, William C. Bullitt. Darcy's continuing interest in educational work was reflected in his role as leader of the New York Workers School in 1930, CP National Education Director (1938), and in numerous lectures given at Party run workers schools in New York, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Darcy also maintained friendships and correspondence with a number of important non-communist progressives, including author Lincoln Steffens, songwriter Yip Harburg and Otto Nathan, executor of the estate of Albert Einstein. </p><p> In 1927-28 and again in 1935-38 Darcy worked in Moscow for the Communist International, serving during his second trip as head of its Anglo-American secretariat, after attending the 7th congress of the CI as a delegate from the US. On both occasions Darcy met with Stalin. </p><p> In early 1944 Darcy and Foster stood alone among the Party leadership in opposition to Browder's estimation of the prospects for post-war American-Soviet harmony. While Foster retreated in the face of overwhelming opposition, Darcy resigned his party offices in protest and shortly thereafter was expelled from the CPUSA by the vote of a commission which his friend Foster was required to chair. Although politically vindicated a year later when Browder was removed from the Party leadership, Darcy did not rejoin the party. Among the factors for this were his belief that the repudiation of Browder's policies was incomplete, and a request by the new leader, Eugene Dennis, to examine a manuscript Darcy had been working on since his expulsion. Darcy for a time maintained some contacts with other "left-wing" expellees, such as William Dunne and Charles Keith. He later became a successful furniture merchant and became active in the Democratic party. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Chonology</span>  </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">1917: Joins Young Peoples Socialist League (YPSL)</span><span class="ead-item">1921: Joins Workers Party (later Communist Party), December, 1921</span><span class="ead-item">1925-27: Head, Young Workers League (later Young Communist League); on CPUSA Politburo as YWL representative</span><span class="ead-item">1926: Marries Emma Blechschmidt</span><span class="ead-item">1927-28: On exec. committee, Young Communist International; Moscow, chair International Childrens Committee (YCI); travels to China and Philippines</span><span class="ead-item">1929-30: New York City; briefly editor of the Daily Worker, head NY Workers school</span><span class="ead-item">1930: Head; International Labor Defense</span><span class="ead-item">1931-36: Head; California district, CPUSA (also included Nevada and Arizona)</span><span class="ead-item">1935-38: Moscow; 7th congress Communist International, head, Anglo-American Secretariat</span><span class="ead-item">1938: CPUSA National Edcuation Director; Central Committee representative for Minnesota-Wisconsin-Dakotas district</span><span class="ead-item">1938-39: Demoted form full Central Committee member to alternate</span><span class="ead-item">1929-44: Eastern Pennsylvania district head</span><span class="ead-item">1944: Expelled from CPUSA</span><span class="ead-item">1945: Declines to rejoin CPUSA</span></span>  </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Sources:</span>  </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">''Agricultural strikes,'' Party Organizer, Aug-Sep (1933), 82-83.</span><span class="ead-item">''The big stick in Latin America - its size and cost,'' Workers Monthly, March (1926), 215-218.</span><span class="ead-item">The Battle for Production (New York, Workers Library Publishers, 1942), 47 pp.</span><span class="ead-item">The Challenge of Youth; Why Every Young Worker Should Join the Young Workers Communist League (Chicago, Ill., Young Workers Communist League of America, 1926), 52 p.</span><span class="ead-item">''The elections in Philadelphia,'' The Communist, December (1943), 1121-1132.</span><span class="ead-item">An Eye_Witness at the Wreckers' Trial (New York : Workers Library Publishers, 1937), 63 p.</span><span class="ead-item">''The Great West Coast Maritime Strike,'' The Communist, 13:7 (1934), 664-686.</span><span class="ead-item">Introduction to Politics.
