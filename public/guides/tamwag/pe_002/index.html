    <p>The Printed Ephemera Collection on the Newspaper Guild is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades. The collection consists largely of agreements, contracts and constitutions, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, leaflets, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications. As a whole, the material offers a general feel for the types of printed matter put out by the Guild as well as a brief introduction to and history of the Guild. In addition to the materials generated by the national body, local bodies from around the country also have material in the collection, generally agreements, contracts, and constitutions. A significant portion of the collection comes from Local 3, the Newspaper Guild of New York. The units of Local 3 are represented by workers of prominent New York newspapers, some still operational and some not, these include: <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The New York Times</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Daily News</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The New York Post</span>, among others.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> The Newspaper Guild, founded by Heywood Broun in 1933 as the American Newspaper Guild, was first conceived primarily as a craft union for editorial staff. After gaining convention approval for a broader base, the structure of the Guild changed considerably. It grew to have more of an industrial trade union structure, organizing not only reporters and editorial staff, but workers in all areas of print production, including advertising, accounting, and circulation. In the 1970s, the Guild dropped the "American" and simply became the Newspaper Guild and in 1995, merged with the Communication Workers of America. As of 2009, the Newspaper Guild had over 34,000 members in the United States and Canada. </p>
