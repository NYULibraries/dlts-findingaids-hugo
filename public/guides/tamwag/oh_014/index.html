  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
    
      <p> The New York City Immigrant Labor History Project was led by Herbert Gutman, a professor of history at the City College of New York (CCNY), between 1972 and 1976.  The project sought to reexamine immigrants' and migrants' patterns of cultural adaptation to urban and industrial life in the early 20th century in order to challenge the prevailing theories in social history at the time.  Gutman designed the project to combine traditional historical research methods with the relatively new approach of oral history.  By documenting the lives of immigrants and migrants who settled in New York, New York between 1900 and 1930 and compiling data on their family relationships, work patterns, and associational lives, Gutman hoped to reveal the ways in which people from rural, non-industrial areas adapted to the structured environment of the factory and the crowded city.   </p><p> Between 1973 and 1975 almost 230 oral history interviews were conducted with Eastern Europeans, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian, and West Indian immigrants; black and Puerto Rican migrants; and the children of immigrants and migrants.  The interviews were conducted by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates in CCNY's Department of History.  Gutman oversaw the entire project and taught courses designed to prepare the student interviewers for conducting the oral histories.  Virginia Yans-McLaughlin, then assistant professor of history at CCNY, co-managed the project with Gutman and directed undergraduate student interviewers.  Three junior faculty members, Leon Fink, William Eric Perkins, and Ari Joel Perlmann, conducted interviews and taught courses related to the project.  Ronald Grele, an oral historian, served as a consultant and provided direction on the oral history interviews and conducted training sessions for the interviewers.    </p><p> The project staff worked closely with labor unions, cultural organizations, and nursing homes in New York City, including the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814; the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home; Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union; the National Council of Jewish Women; and the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged.  These organizations facilitated meetings between project staff and interested members or residents and allowed the project staff to arrange and conduct interviews. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
    
      <p> The New York City Immigrant Labor History Project Oral History Collection consists of 222 interviews with Eastern European, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian, and West Indian immigrants and black and Puerto Rican migrants, most of whom settled in New York, New York between 1900 and 1930.  Topics include education, childhood, and early life in the narrators' countries and states of origin; arrival at Ellis Island and first impressions of New York City; assimilation; women's roles in the workforce and in the household; courtship, marriage, and  family life; processes of acquiring and retaining work; job responsibilities, wages, and working conditions; ethnic and racial makeup of different workforces, factories, and shops; labor unions and organizing in different industries; ethnic and inter-racial relations in the community and the workplace; living conditions in New York City neighborhoods; politics; leisure activities; and religion.   </p><p> The interviews capture the narrators' pre-industrial experiences as a way of exploring their adaptation to life in an urban, industrial environment by covering all aspects of their life experiences.  They record the narrators' memories from their childhoods through to the time of the interviews.  The majority of the narrators were in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, with at least two narrators being over 100 years old.  The interviews contain recollections of the narrators' countries and states of origin; their reasons for emigrating or migrating; their working and family lives in New York City and elsewhere in the United States (US); their union and political activity; and religious, ethnic, or social organizations to which they may have belonged.  </p><p> The narrators include first and second generation immigrants and migrants; men and women; Jews and Christians; and anarchists, Communists, Democrats, Socialists, and Republicans.  Occupations represented in this collection include garment workers, fur workers, longshoremen, musicians, household employees, cooks, carpenters, dancers, union organizers, electricians, elevator operators, and taxi drivers.  Labor unions represented in this collection include the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of America; Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees International Union; International Fur and Leather Workers Union; International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; International Longshoremen's Association; International Union of Operating Engineers; Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union; New York City Taxi Drivers Union Local 3036; United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America; United Furniture Workers of America; and United Hatters of North America.  Cultural, ethnic, and social organizations discussed include the Carroll Park Senior Citizens Center; Congress of Italian Americans Organization; Council Workshop for Senior Citizens sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women; Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center; and the Workmen's Circle. </p><p> The interviews include women who never worked outside the home, both married and unmarried; women who left the workforce permanently after marriage and childbirth; women who returned to the workforce after the birth of each of their children; and others who returned only after all of their children had entered primary school or entered the workforce themselves.  Some narrators settled first in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, and Illinois before moving to New York.  Others immigrated to other European countries or Cuba before immigrating to the US.  Some returned a number of times to their countries of origin before settling permanently in the US.  There are interviews with people who became heavily involved in the labor movement while others did not concern themselves with union activity.   </p><p> The collection includes 11 compilations of excerpts from interviews, based on a specific topic, such as ethnicity, politics, and neighborhoods.  There are also recordings of roundtable discussions with potential narrators at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens on 125th Street in Manhattan, New York and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Local 22. </p><p> Transcripts, indices, interview fact sheets, subject cards, and summaries are available for many of the interviews and are noted in the container summary when available.  An electronic version of all transcripts, indices, interview fact sheets, subject cards, and summaries are available by request.  Many of the transcripts do not contain the full interview.  The indices contain subject terms or phrases with the corresponding time on the recording at which they are discussed.  Some of the summaries contain a brief description of what is discussed at a certain time in the recording; others contain synopses of interview highlights without the corresponding time notes.  The interview fact sheets contain information relevant to the interests of Gutman and the project staff and were filled out by the narrators; a small amount of these were received with the donation.  The subject cards contain the same sort of information as the indices and summaries, but are typed on index cards and separated into subjects such as family, work, and education before and after immigration. </p>
