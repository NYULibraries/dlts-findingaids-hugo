    <p>Jay Leyda (1910-1988) was a leading film historian, filmmaker, photographer, archivist, translator, teacher, and noted Sergei Eisenstein, Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville scholar. Leyda studied directing with Sergei Eisenstein at the Moscow State Film School, became a correspondent for <span class="ead-title">Theatre Arts Monthly</span> and <span class="ead-title">New Theatre</span>, and was an art critic for the <span class="ead-title">Moscow News</span>. In 1936, Leyda was the assistant to Iris Barry, curator of the Film Library of the Museum of Modern Art, but resigned amidst allegations that he was a subversive agent. Leyda went to Hollywood in 1942 where he was a technical advisor on films on Russian subjects and began work on Herman Melville documents which led to a number of books on the subject. In 1973, Leyda became professor of Cinema Studies at NYU. He died in 1988. His wife, Si Lan Chen Leyda (1909- ), was a modern dancer who pioneered the use of Chinese dance elements. Si-Lan Chen was born in Trinidad and attended the Bolshoi Ballet School and Vera Maya's school in Moscow where she met and married Leyda. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she toured and worked in Hollywood as a choreographer and dance instructor, and occasionally appeared in films. The collection includes their biographical material, correspondence, writings, and material pertaining to their various pursuits.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Jay Leyda (1910-1988) was a leading film historian, best known for his work on Soviet cinema and director Sergei Eisenstein, and on Chinese cinema. He was also a film maker, photographer, archivist, translator, professor of cinema studies at New York University, and was also noted for his Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville scholarship. His wife, Si Lan Chen Leyda (1909- ) was a modern dancer who pioneered the use of Chinese dance elements. </p><p> Jay Leyda was born on February 12, 1910 in Detroit, Michigan, and was adopted and raised by his grandmother in Dayton, Ohio, after his mother's early divorce. In 1930 Jay moved to New York City to work for photographer Ralph Steiner. Leyda was published in <span class="ead-title">Arts Weekly</span>, exhibited at the Julien Levy gallery, worked for the Workers Film and Photo League, was a founding member of the Film Society and the Film Forum, and arranged music to be played during silent films. At this time he formed a liaison with the activist attorney Carol King and may have joined the Communist Party USA. In 1932 Leyda made his first film <span class="ead-title">A Bronx Morning</span>, which led to his September 1933 acceptance to the Moscow State Film School, where he studied directing with Sergei Eisenstein. Leyda became a correspondent for <span class="ead-title">Theatre Arts Monthly</span>and <span class="ead-title">New Theatre</span>, and using the pen name James Lincoln, was an art critic for the <span class="ead-title">Moscow News</span>. In 1934 Leyda married Si Lan Chen, whose sister Yolanda worked as a camera operator for Mosfilms. In 1934-35 Leyda worked for Eisenstein as photographer and archivist during the making of <span class="ead-title">Bezhin Meadow.</span> </p><p> In 1936 the Museum of Modern Art offered Leyda the position of Assistant Curator of Films, and he brought to New York a rare print of <span class="ead-title">Potemkin</span>and other films collected throughout Europe. Leyda expanded MOMA's film collection and wrote pamphlets on the history of film. A 1940 newspaper article alleged he was a subversive agent and his resignation was requested. In 1941 Eisenstein commissioned Leyda to translate and edit a group of essays which became <span class="ead-title">The Film Sense</span>(1942). Leyda moved to Hollywood in 1942 where he was a technical advisor on films on Russian subjects, including <span class="ead-title">Mission to Moscow</span>. At this time Leyda began his work on Herman Melville documents (planned as a birthday present for Eisenstein) which led to <span class="ead-title">The Melville Log: a documentary life of Herman Melville</span>(1951), as well as the <span class="ead-title">Complete Stories of Melville</span>(1949) and the <span class="ead-title">Portable Melville</span>(1952). In 1943 he was drafted into the Army but was discharged shortly thereafter. A translation project begun at this time was <span class="ead-title">The Musorgsky Reader</span>, a 1947 collaboration with Sergei Bertensson, with whom Leyda later co-authored <span class="ead-title">Sergei Rachmaninoff: A Lifetime in Music</span>, (1956). Highlights of Leyda's continuing work on Soviet cinema include <span class="ead-title">Film Form: Essays in Film Theory</span>(1949), his 1954 study film from the negative of Eisenstein's unfinished <span class="ead-title">Que Viva Mexico, Kino, a History of the Russian and Soviet film</span>(1960), and <span class="ead-title">Eisenstein at Work</span>(1980). </p><p> In 1954 Leyda left Los Angeles and for the next twenty years traveled widely, living abroad much of the time with London as a home base. From 1959-1964, Leyda spent much of his time in Peking at the China Film Archive, resulting in <span class="ead-title">Dianying (Electric Shadows): an Account of Films and the Film Audience in China</span>(1972). From 1964-1969, Leyda spent much of his time working at the Staatliches Filmarchiv in East Berlin in the German Democratic Republic, and in 1964 he published his <span class="ead-title">Films Beget Films: a Study of the Compilation Film</span>. Non-film undertakings included <span class="ead-title">The Years and Hours of Emily Dickinson</span>(1960), and the 1964 performance of the opera <span class="ead-title">Bartelby the Scrivener</span>, for which Leyda wrote the libretto. In 1973, after brief teaching jobs at Yale and York Universities, Leyda became professor of Cinema Studies at NYU. He published <span class="ead-title">Voices of Film Experience: 1894-to the Present</span>(1977), regularly visited the USSR and published several collections of Eisenstein materials, and continued to write, lecture, curate, and consult widely on film and other topics. Leyda died on February 15, 1988. </p><p> BIOGRAPHY: SI-LAN CHEN LEYDA </p><p> Si-Lan Chen was born in Trinidad and moved to London in 1912 where she studied dance at the Stedman Academy. In 1926 she joined her father, who had become secretary for Sun Yat-sen and Foreign Minister of the Canton government. In 1927, after Chiang Kai-shek took power, the family fled to Moscow. Chen enrolled in the Bolshoi Ballet School but disliked the discipline and switched to Vera Maya's school. She gave her first important recital in 1930 at the Moscow Conservatory. After adapting her style to reflect a proletarian ideology, she was proclaimed the first modern Soviet dancer. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s she toured the U.S., Mexico and the West Indies performing in benefits for China relief. In the mid-1940s Chen worked in Hollywood as a choreographer, dance instructor and occasionally appeared on film. Her career was complicated by her long struggle to obtain U.S. citizenship. Chen's biography, Footnote to History, was published in 1984. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">JAY LEYDA: SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY</span>  </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">I.
