  <div>
      <p> The Rabbi Arthur Schneier Papers consists of material collected and created by Rabbi Arthur Schneier dating from 1956 to 2016 pertaining to his work as a rabbi and international advocate for peace, human rights, and religious freedom. The bulk of the collection documents Schneier's work as the president and founder of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, or ACF, an interfaith coalition of business and religious leaders promoting tolerance and conflict resolution throughout the world. ACF created and co-sponsored protests, seminars, conferences, summits, and awards about creating international peace and tolerance through conflict resolution and the expansion of human and religious rights. Material from these events include: programs, correspondence, schedules, lists of attendees, agendas, press clippings and releases, photographs, images, video recordings, and travel documents. A small number of VHS tapes, microcassette tapes, and audio cassette tapes were recorded of ACF's annual award dinners and luncheons as well as the seminars and conferences co-sponsored and created by ACF. ACF also hosted visiting political and religious leaders of international renown and sent delegations abroad to report to meet with international political and religious leaders. The collection mostly contains paper-based and born-digital material, with a small portion of audio cassette tapes documenting those meetings. </p><p> Rabbi Arthur Schneier also attended several domestic and international events as individual advocate for religious tolerance and international peace. A large portion of the collection documents Schneier's constant trips to Israel, Europe, and East Asia to attend international events about religious and human rights. Material from Schneier's trips includes: itineraries, schedules, correspondence, photographs, travel documents and ephemera, and reports. A small number of audio cassette tapes and 16mm films were recorded from various international and domestic events attended by Rabbi Schneier as an advocate for religious rights. Another small part of the collection consists of photographs, images, programs, correspondence, born-digital sound and video recordings that record Rabbi Schneier receiving awards and honorary doctorate degrees for his vocational work as a rabbi and advocate. Finally, this collection contains material that documents Schneier's vocation as a rabbi first as the Rabbi of Congregation B'nai Jacob located in Brooklyn, New York then as the Senior Rabbi of Park East Synagogue in New York, New York. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> At the time of accessioning, July 2017, most of the materials were left in their original file folders and housed primarily in record cartons with spacers as a means to reflect the box inventory written by Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives' Curator, Michael Koncewicz. Further accretions were rehoused in appropriately sized boxes but the original box numbering from the inventory has been maintained. Some boxes donated in the 2019 accrual were not listed on the inventory and were added to the end of the inventory as boxes 192-203. </p><p> The collection received minimal rearrangement, rehousing in manuscript boxes, and more granular description during processing from May to October 2019. While the collection had good folder titles, the labels on all of the folders were falling off. Most of the folders in the collection were overfilled and had pieces of dessicated rubber bands stuck to them. The folders were filed within hanging folders and accordion folders. There were several cases of overfilled and underfilled record cartons. During processing, the material in these record cartons were transferred into properly sized boxes and rehoused in scored archival folders. Audiovisual material and physical digital media were housed together as appropriate. Separation sheets were created to sustain the intellectual relationship between paper-based materials and audiovisual materials and physical digital media. Preservation photocopies were created for material printed on thermal fax paper as well as newspaper articles. Hanging folders and accordion folders were removed from the collection. Duplicate material in all formats were deaccessioned from the collection. Original folder titles were used, with descriptive enhancements added as necessary.  </p><p> Born-digital material was inventoried, labeled, and imaged. Discs were processed using Forensic Toolkit, and video and audio were imaged and uploaded to permanent storage. More than half of the optical discs and floppy disks were deaccessioned due to duplication, damage, or because they contained no files. </p><p> New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. </p>

  <div>
      <p> During accessioning, the curator was able to weed out most of the boxes that contained administrative and/or financial files. However, there were some administrative files embedded within certain boxes, especially the ones that focus on the Annual Award Dinners which were weeded during processing. Additionally, there were several boxes full of unannotated envelopes, invitation and RSVP cards for the Appeal of Conscience Foundation's Annual Awards Dinner. Two copies of the invitations and RSVP cards were retained, the rest of the material was deaccessioned. There were some boxes that contained receipts, tax return forms, tax audit correspondence, reimbursement documents, and a financial investment portfolio for the United States-Japan Foundation that were deaccessioned from the collection. There were several folders of articles, booklets, pamphlets, and reports about international countries which were not created by the Appeal of Conscience Foundation that had little to no research value which were also deaccessioned. In the same vein as the articles, booklets, pamphlets, and reports, the donor also kept folders of speeches by world leaders from various conferences, summits, forum, news conferences that are not annotated which were also discarded. There were two yarmulkes, housed in boxes 108 and 183, that were offered back to the donor and deaccessioned.  </p><p> After consulting with the digital archivist, six data cartridges were separated from the collection, offered back to the donor, and deaccessioned. These cartridges were labeled as backup files and are currently unable to be imaged by NYU. The digital archivist said they will need to be sent to a vendor and probably do not contain information of high research value. There were a number of optical discs and floppy disks which blank, damaged, or had copyright issues that were deaccessioned from the collection. Please see the deaccessioning checklist in the collection file for a detailed list of optical disc and floppy disk deaccessions. </p><p> Two audio cassette tapes were removed from the collection due to copyright issues. Fifteen audio cassette tapes were also removed from the collection, because they were blank. One 16mm film was removed from the collection due to copyright issues. </p>
