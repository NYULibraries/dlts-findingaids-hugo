  <div>
      <p> The Central Trades and Labor Council of the American Federation of Labor merged with the New York City Congress of Industrial Organizations Council on February 19, 1959 to form the New York City Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO. This followed the earlier merger on December 9, 1958 of New York State's AFL and CIO. </p><p> The New York City Central Labor Council is an organization comprised of nearly 400 local union affiliates. It acts only on local activities and concerns and it does not issue statements on AFL-CIO policy. According to its constitution, the council's purpose is to further the rights of workers to organize in unions and to bargain collectively, to advocate legislation which is beneficial to workers and oppose that which is not, and to correct abuses and to insure the workers their just rights.  </p><p> The New York City Central Labor Council also has social and political purposes driven by the commitment to help all people who work for a living improve their working conditions and raise their standard of living. Further, the New York City Central Labor Council strives to preserve workers' rights to act together for mutual aid and advancement, to further the cause of unions, and to strengthen civil rights. It acts as a central force, providing assistance and education through its various committees and councils. </p><p> The regular activities of the New York City Central Labor Council are directed by its executive officers, Executive Board, and Delegates' Council meetings. The planning and execution of programs and conferences are conducted by various standing and special committees. These committees are composed of members from affiliated local unions, each with officers and advisory consulting staff. An important special committee is the Labor Day Parade Committee.  </p><p> In 1957, Harry Van Arsdale was elected president of the Central Trades and Labor Council of the AFL. Following the merger in 1959, he became the President of the Central Labor Council. During his presidency (1957-1986), the council established many diverse committees and programs such as the Rehabilitation Council (1963), Hispanic Labor Committee (1970), and the Black Trade Unionist Leadership Committee (1972). The Council was also instrumental in founding the Harry Van Arsdale Jr. Center for Labor Studies, in 1971, to further labor education at Empire State College, State University of New York.  </p><p> Upon Harry Van Arsdale's death in 1986, his son, Thomas Van Arsdale, was elected to the post of president.  </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The collection consists of approximately 8,200 photographs, most of which are 8x10 black and white glossy prints. Many were shot for potential use in <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Labor Chronicle</span>, the Council's newspaper (published between the 1960s and early 1980s), and other Council publications. </p><p> The images span the 1940s through the late 1990s, although the bulk of the photographs date from the 1970s and 1980s.  Particularly well documented are Council special committees; demonstrations by Council affiliates; and annual Council activities and events, such as the New York City Labor Day Parade and Lincoln Birthday Dinner. </p><p> Prominent individuals are also well-represented, both in portraits and group shots.  These include the presidents of the various locals represented on the Council, Executive Board members, and the officers of the Council. The officers most well documented are: Harry Van Arsdale, President; Harry Avrutin, Secretary; Morris Iushewitz, Secretary (Avrutin's immediate predecessor); and William Bowe, Treasurer.  </p><p> The collection also includes numerous photographs of many major New York City and New York State political figures and office-holders from the 1940s and onwards, shown posed with Council members or other labor leaders.  Notable inclusions are mayors Robert F. Wagner, Jr., Abraham Beame, Edward Koch, Rudolph Giuliani, and Governors Mario Cuomo and George Pataki. </p><p> The principal photographers in this collection are: Sam Reiss, Alexander Archer, Dan Miller, Jules Geller, and Mildred Gross; their credit lines may be seen stamped on the back of many of the images. </p>
