    <p><span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span> is a nationally circulated ethnic newspaper published weekly in New York City since 1928. The paper covers political, social, entertainment, and sporting news from both Ireland and Irish America, in addition to national and international content from the perspective of the Irish American community. This collection consists of the photographic prints, transparencies, and photographic slides used to produce <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span>. Common subjects documented include Irish and Irish American politicians, society events, sporting events, musical groups, arts and cultural events, and visiting celebrities and dignitaries. The files provide visual documentation of Irish American communities and American assimilation processes in the late 20th century. Particularly rich are the images portraying the ways in which these populations negotiated their dual identities and transmuted cultural traditions.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span> is a nationally circulated ethnic newspaper published weekly in New York City.The paper was founded in 1928 by Charles Connolly, a native of Co. Monaghan. In 1955, Patrick J. Grimes, a native of Co. Offaly, purchased the paper, which was subsequently run by members of the Grimes family for the remainder of the twentieth century. In 2002 the newspaper was sold to Irish businessman Sean Finlay, who sold it to the Belfast Media Group in 2007.  Máirtin Ó Muilleoir is the current CEO and publisher. </p><p> The paper covers political, social, entertainment, and sporting news from both Ireland and Irish America, with a robust classified section targeted at domestic help, legal notices, and construction employment.  News stories featured in most daily newspapers also often received coverage, from the perspective of the Irish American community. </p><p>

  <div>
      <p> This collection consists of photographic prints, transparencies, and photographic slides used to produce <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span>, but is not limited to images published in the newspaper.  The majority of the images in the collection were submitted by <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span> staff and contract photographers, although some photographs were sent to the paper by unsolicited individuals. Photographers for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span> featured in this collection include John Bourke, Peter Dolan, Kevin Kennedy, Tom Matthews, and Michael O'Rourke.  Also represented, particularly in Series V. Artists and Series VI. Film, Television, and Theatre, are publicity photographs from a variety of sources, including public relations firms and production studios. </p><p> The majority of photographs featured in <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span>'s photo morgue document Irish and Irish American people and communities, news events, and subjects throughout the greater New York City area. The collection also features numerous American and international figures and organizations interacting with Irish American communities.  Politicians, society events, sporting events, schools and youth organizations, musical groups, arts and cultural events, as well as visiting celebrities and dignitaries are among the most common subjects documented throughout the collection. </p><p> The files are particularly rich in images related to Irish immigration and American assimilation processes during the latter half of the 20th century.  Numerous images of Irish and Irish American communities and their leaders provide visual documentation of the ways in which these populations negotiated their dual identities and transmuted cultural traditions. Furthermore, the materials featured in this collection provide insight on editorial decisions regarding the prioritization of news, specifically as it pertains to content.   </p><p> The majority of the collection consists of images taken in the United States, with the exception of Series II, which documents tourism, business, politics, sports, and various other topics specific to Ireland.  Additionally, there is no distinction made within Series V - VII between Irish and American origins.  For example, images in Series V. Artists, include photographs taken of American artists in Ireland as well as of Irish artists in America. Due to the multifaceted nature of the collection's images, individual events, people, or subjects may appear in multiple locations throughout the collection or within a single series. </p><p> Many of the prints show permanent evidence of their use, including crop marks, retouching by highlighting or shading, or other manipulation of the image. These marks are part of the record of a working newspaper and have been preserved as part of the history of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span>'s photograph morgue. With the advent of digital photography and other technologies, the quantity of photos included in the collection declines beginning in the late 1990s, continuing steadily downward to 2004, which represents the latest date in the collection. </p>

  <div>
      <p> Professor of Irish Studies Marion Casey boxed <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Irish Echo</span>'s photo morgue at the newspaper's current offices in lower Manhattan before transferring the collection to the Archives of Irish America. Although there was not any consistent order to the photographs, there was evidence of an attempt to organize individuals and subjects alphabetically, in addition to sporadic efforts in the 1970s through 1990s to group all photographs by the month in which they were published in the newspaper.  In an effort to assist discovery and retrieval independent of the newspaper's content, a decision was made to solidify an alphabetical arrangement based on individuals, organizations, and subjects. The distinction between Ireland, Irish America, and the United States is original to the arrangement of materials at the newspaper's office – and is particularly pronounced with regards to politics and sports - and has been preserved in the series arrangement. </p><p> During processing, notations identifying individuals and the approximate dates of particular events were made in pencil on the backs of photographs.  Additionally, many photos bear a notation such as "Pre-1970s, 1980s Box;"  it should be noted that no such box exists.  Finally, during the arranging process, some smaller sized photographs were separated and housed in snapshot boxes; snapshots comprise Boxes #14 - #19.  Also removed were slides, oversize photographs, and oversize color separations, which are now located in Boxes 20, 21, and 22, respectively.  All photographs retain original intellectual arrangement within their series or subseries.   </p><p> A further donation of materials was received by the archives while the collection was being processed; these materials remain unprocessed and will be integrated into the current arrangement schema at a later date. </p>
