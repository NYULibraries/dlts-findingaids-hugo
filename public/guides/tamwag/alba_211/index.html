    <p>Robert Colodny (1915-1997) fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. He returned to the U.S. in 1938 with a severe head injury. He recovered and served in with the U.S. Army in Alaska during World War II. Colodny received his Ph.D. in history and philosophy in 1950 and joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh in 1959. In 1961, a Pennsylvania State representative accused Colodny of being a Communist sympathizer, jeopardizing his faculty position at the University of Pittsburgh. After a HUAC hearing and a University inquiry, Colodny was cleared and his position secured. This collection documents Colodny's writings from World War II; his work as a writer and editor of academic, political and historical material; his correspondence and activities with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades (VALB); and his lifelong involvement in a range of progressive causes.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Robert Garland Colodny (1915-1997) was born in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1936, after having been expelled from Columbia University for refusing to take certain courses, Colodny became a chemistry student at the University of Chicago; there he expressly sought out recruiters for the International Brigades. In February 1937, Colodny sailed for Spain on the <span class="ead-title">Isle de France</span>. By late summer, he had been shot between the eyes, contracted gangrene of the brain, and was expected to die. But he recovered, and, though bandaged, weak and blind in one eye, was sent back to a front in the Aragon Mountains. It was not long before he was stricken with a high fever, however, and in March 1938, Colodny was granted permission to leave Spain on a sealed train to Paris. He sailed for the U.S. in April, partially paralyzed and blinded on the left side. </p><p> Despite his health history, Colodny joined the U.S. Army in 1941, and served for four years, stationed in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in Army Intelligence alongside fellow-sergeant Dashiell Hammett. With Hammett, Colodny produced a Company newsletter, <span class="ead-title">The Adakian</span>, designed to boost troop morale, and co-authored a book commissioned by the Army, <span class="ead-title">The Battle of the Aleutians</span>; they also co-wrote and broadcast a radio program. </p><p> Colodny earned his doctorate in history and philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley in 1950. His Masters Thesis on the Spanish Civil War was later published as <span class="ead-title">The Struggle for Madrid</span>(1958). In 1959, Colodny joined the history faculty of the University of Pittsburgh. Two years later, Pennsylvania State Representative John T. Walsh accused Colodny of being a Communist sympathizer for having made a statement supporting the Cuban revolution. This was one of the last anti-Communist investigations in the nation's history. His career in jeopardy, Colodny fought a year-long battle to clear his name. In addition to his appearances before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he was cleared after stating that he had been misquoted on Cuba and denying membership in the Communist Party, Colodny underwent a separate investigation by the University of Pittsburgh. Ultimately Chancellor Edward Litchfield stood behind Colodny, declaring the University's strong commitment to protecting academic freedom. Colodny taught at the University of Pittsburgh until his retirement in 1984. </p><p> Colodny remained politically involved with progressive causes, including the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, throughout his life. His expertise in the many aspects of the history of science led to his activism for a number of environmental causes. Colodny was a member of VALB, regularly contributing to the group's publication, <span class="ead-title">The Volunteer</span>, and dedicating his energy especially to preserving the memory and lessons of the Spanish Civil War. He also served on VALB's historical preservation committee. </p><p> In addition to his voluminous scientific writing and book reviewing, Colodny wrote and lectured extensively on the political implications of the Spanish Civil War. He also edited, consulted and contributed to many book, radio, film, and television projects on the subject, including work on <span class="ead-title">Death in the Olive Groves: The Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War</span>by Arthur Landis; and <span class="ead-title">Prisoners of the Good Fight</span>by Carl Geiser. </p><p> Colodny died in 1997 of colon cancer. </p><p> Sources: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">The Struggle for Madrid: The Central Epic of the Spanish Conflict, 1936-37</span>(New York: Paine-Whitman, 1958)</span><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">Spain: The Glory and the Tragedy</span>(New York: Humanities Press, 1970)</span><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">Spain and Vietnam: The Fight for Freedom</span>(New York : Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, 1967)</span></span>  </p>
