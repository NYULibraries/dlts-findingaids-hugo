  <div>
      <p> Daniel Cassidy (1943-2008), an Irish-American writer, singer, filmmaker, and professor, was born in Brooklyn in 1943.  He attended the the New York Military Academy on a musical scholarship, and studied English Literature and Creative Writing at Cornell University.  His first job was at the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Times</span>, which he left to pursue screenwriting full time.  From the late 1960s through the 1980s, Cassidy performed as a musician, but gradually transitioned into composing his own music.  He performed at, among other places, Carnegie Hall, the LA Civic Auditorium, and on the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Tonight Show</span>.  In addition to his musical work, Cassidy was also a prolific screenwriter--he sold film scripts and treatments, and worked in both film development and television production.  His 1996 documentary, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Civil Rights and Civil Wrongs</span>, about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, was nominated for an Emmy Award, and his film <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Uncensored Voices</span> aired on PBS.   </p><p> In the 1990s, Cassidy's interests turned toward research and academia.  Cassidy was a professor at New College of California, in the Media & Film Studies Department, where he taught storytelling, newspaper writing, and broadcast history classes.  In 1995, he founded the Irish Studies Program (An Leann Eireannach) at New College.  Cassidy was co-director of the program, one of the first in the country, until the college closed in 2008.  Additionally, Cassidy was co-founder of the Crossroads Irish American Festival in San Francisco, and served as director of the festival until his death. </p><p> Cassidy was a prolific contributor to newspapers and journals.  His book, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">How the Irish Invented Slang: The Secret Language of the Crossroads</span>, was published in 2007.  The book, which looked at the influence of Irish phrases on slang that developed in America in the 1800s, won the 2007 American Book Award for nonfiction.  The book was met with much praise from within the Irish-American community, but was criticized by linguists for lacking evidence to support the book's claims.  Cassidy's other research interest was African-American and Irish intermarriage in New York City in the 1800s, although he did not develop this enough before his death to publish any scholarly work on the topic.  Cassidy died on October 11, 2008. </p>

  <div>
      <p> When this material arrived, there was no discernible order inherent in the way the material was arranged.  There were no folders or other means of organization, and materials related to each other were scatted among the various boxes.  The current organization of the collection was imposed by the archivist.  Once the order was established, materials were all placed in new acid-free folders and boxes.  Folder titles were assigned, as there were no pre-existing folder titles. </p><p> The dates on the folders containing previously published (secondary source) or census material indicate the dates that Cassidy annotated the material, not the date of original publication.  There are a wide range of original publication dates within the secondary source material; the majority of the historical newspaper clippings and plays were originially published between 1880-1920.  Dates in brackets are best approximations of when Cassidy was annotating the material. </p>
