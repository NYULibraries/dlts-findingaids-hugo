    <p>Arthur H. Landis (1917-1986) joined the 15th International Brigade in 1937 and fought with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. In 1967, Landis wrote <span class="ead-title">The Abraham Lincoln Brigade</span>about Americans in the Spanish Civil War, and later published <span class="ead-title">Spain! The Unfinished Revolution</span>, about the political complexities of the war. The collection contains photographs from Landis' scrapbook and his mother Alice Fries' photo albums, including images of his childhood and family. Alice Fries was a singer, dancer and member of the American Guild of Variety Artists. Images from the Spanish Civil War include bombed buildings, Ernie Parlor and unidentified international volunteers, medical personnel and vehicles, and Spanish soldiers. There are additional photographs of demonstrations in the United States attended by the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. The collection includes color slides of Spanish cities: Albacete, Belchite, Brunete, Murcia, and Teruel, and maps of various Republican fronts. Many images depict Landis' daily life in Hermosa Beach and Los Angeles, California.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Arthur H. Landis was born into a family of vaudeville performers in Birmingham, Alabama in 1917, and spent most of his youth in Redondo Beach, California. Landis joined the 15th International Brigade in 1937 and fought with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. He worked as a scout, a typographer, and an artillery spotter with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion, and fought in the battles of Aragon and Teruel, where he was injured. Landis also worked for a stint for an intelligence unit, and participated in an aborted operation to blow up the Italian Fleet headquarters. Just before Barcelona fell to Franco, Landis helped load the 15th Brigade Archives onto a Soviet ship. He sailed back to the U.S. on the R.M.S. Ausonia in December 1938. For further biographical information on Landis, and to review the scope and contents of his manuscript collection see, Guide to the Arthur H. Landis Papers, ALBA 66 [Note: hotlink]. </p><p> Landis' mother Alice Fries traveled to small towns across the Midwest and West working variety shows—including the Nut Chorus and Ralston Chorus—as a singer and dancer. Fries became Alice Landis when she married William N. Landis, Arthur's father. William, also a performer, entered the army in 1920. By 1922 the couple was estranged. Alice married her stage partner, Richard Yaryan, and changed her name to Alice Yaryan. The duo performed under the stage name fast-Stepping Man and Maid. In the late 1930s Alice sometimes used Alice Harper as a stage name (her father's name was Harper) when she performed in the duo Harper & King. Fries was a member of the American Guild of Variety Artists. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I</span>: Photographs. The Landis Photographic Collection consists predominantly of photographs from Landis' scrapbooks and the personal photo albums of his mother, Alice Fries. These items contained images of Landis' childhood and family: grandmother Ethel Fries, father William (Bill) N. Landis, and brother William (Billie) H. Landis. Other family members represented in the series include Landis' aunts Edith and Mabel Fries, cousins Grace Fries and Helen Fries-Topping, uncle Jim Topping, and nephew William D. Landis. </p><p> Landis' scrapbooks were disassembled and the photographs divided according to subject category. Photocopies of the original order of Landis' photo albums are contained in Box 4, Folders 9-12. Loose photographs from Alice Fries' keepsake albums were removed and added to the photograph collection, arranged according to subject category. Her albums that contained only photographs were preserved intact. Photocopies indicating the original order of the disassembled albums are in Box 4, Folders 7-8. </p><p> Images from the Spanish Civil War include, bombed buildings, Arthur Landis, Ernie Parlor and unidentified international volunteers, medical personnel and vehicles, and Spanish soldiers. There are additional photographs of political demonstrations and rallies in the United States attended by the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade including one image of Dolores Ibárruri in Spain and one image of Paul Robeson, Morris Fishman, and Bart van der Schelling singing at a gathering in Los Angeles, California. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II</span>: Slides. Most of the 53 slides of Spanish cities, rivers and other sites of combat were taken by Jack Levine, following AL's instructions, in Spain in June and October 1966. The collection contains two slides of the Valley of the Fallen, a memorial to the dead of the Spanish Civil War, where only General Francisco Franco and José Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of the Falange, were commemorated by name. The series also contains five images of maps depicting Republican fronts credited to the California State College at Los Angeles. AL used the slides in a presentation to veterans and friends in Los Angeles. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series III</span>: Negatives. The negatives are contained in a separate box from the photographs and slides. The 47 images in this series are mostly of Landis' Hermosa Beach home and neighborhood. There is also one image of Landis as a child, one image of Landis with his brother and one image of Landis in Spain during the Civil War. The series also contains images of maps depicting Republican fronts during the Spanish Civil War and two images of Dolores Ibárruri at a veterans' event in Spain. The negative of Landis in Spain matches the print in Box 2, Folder 16. One of the negatives of Dolores Ibárruri matches the print in Box 2, Folder 5 .The remaining negatives do not match any prints. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series IV</span>: Photocopied Photo Albums and Scrapbooks. These photocopies display the original order of the Arthur Landis' and Alice Fries' photo albums and scrapbooks prior to disassembling. </p>

      <p> The Arthur H. Landis Photograph Collection was donated to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives by Arthur H. Landis in the early 1990s. This collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University. The images in the Landis Photograph Collection were separated from the Landis manuscript collection at the time of processing. </p>
