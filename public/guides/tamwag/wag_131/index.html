    <p>The Utility Workers Union of America Local 1-2 represents members working in the electric, gas, water, and nuclear industries in the New York area, with the bulk of their members employed by ConEd.  Local 1-2 evolved out of the Utility Workers Organizing Committee (UWOC) established by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1938.  The collection documents the origins of the Local and its expansion to include employees at companies other than ConEd; elections of officers and of changes to bylaws; various political parties within the Local, including the Justice Party, Members 1st Party, New Directions Caucus, Administration, and the Unity Party; and the planning of strikes and positions taken by different political parties within the Local on the strike or possibility of the strike, as well as picket duty lists, schedules, and photographs of demonstrations and rallies.  These materials date from 1927 to 2004, with the bulk of the materials dating from the 1960s to late 1990s.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Utility Workers Union of America Local 1-2 represents members working in the electric, gas, water, and nuclear industries in the New York area, with the bulk of their members employed by ConEd.  Local 1-2 evolved out of the Utility Workers Organizing Committee (UWOC) established by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1938.  </p><p> From the mid-1930s, the employees in the New York utility industry had company unions, which were easily controlled by management. In 1937, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate, obtained the right to represent the Consolidated Edison (ConEd) employees through a consent recognition, rather than through an election of the employees.  The IBEW issued charters to the seven company unions:  two charters were issued to ConEd employees; the third went to the New York Steam employees; the fourth to Consolidated Telegraph & Electrical Subway employees; the fifth to New York and Queens Electric Light and Power employees; the sixth to Brooklyn Edison Company employees; and the seventh to the employees of two Westchester affiliates.  The members of Locals 1 and 2 were not happy with their new union as the IBEW chartered them as "B" locals, meaning the members could not perform work that the IBEW reserved for its "A" members, who were not ConEd employees. </p><p> In 1940, the ConEd employees withdrew from the IBEW and the seven chartered locals formed the Brotherhood of Consolidated Edison Employees (BCEE), which was independent from the AFL and the CIO.  After winning an election ordered and conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, the BCEE took the name Local 1-2, representing the separate identities of two major categories within ConEd, plant and clerical workers, and eventually came to represent all unionized workers at ConEd. </p><p> In 1945, Local 1-2 accepted an invitation to become part of the UWOC.  A year later the UWOC became the Utility Workers Union of America, CIO with more than 225 locals organized nationwide.
Throughout its history, the Local has had a contentious relationship with ConEd, particularly over contract negotiations.  Negotiations would often result in strikes.  One nine-week strike in 1983 resulted in losses for the Local and widespread dissatisfaction with the Local leadership among members.   </p><p> There have been a number of power struggles within the Local, between a number of officers and political parties.  One of the major points of contention was the trusteeship instituted by the National in 1998 due to alleged mismanagement of funds by the president of the Local, Joseph Flaherty.  The Members 1st party backed the trustee, James Keller, while the Justice Party wanted to gain control of the Local back from the National.   </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Utility Workers Union of America, Local 1-2 Records document the history of the Local from its beginnings as an employee representation plan for Consolidated Edison employees to a modern Local representing workers at ConEd and other companies in the electric, gas, water, and nuclear industries across the New York area.  The collection contains correspondence, memoranda, and minutes documenting the origins of the Local and its expansion to include employees at companies other than ConEd.  These materials date from 1927 to 2004, with the bulk of the materials dating from the 1960s to late 1990s. </p><p> Elections of officers and of changes to the Local's bylaws are documented through correspondence, notices, posters, polling lists, and election results.  These include materials documenting the 1940 election which resulted in the creation of Local 1-2 as a separate local representing ConEd workers.   </p><p> Contract negotiations from the origins of Local 1-2 through the 2000s are well documented.  Negotiations surrounding the creation of Local 1-2 in 1940 include correspondence and memoranda between the Brotherhood of Consolidated Edison Employees, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, and the National Labor Relations Board.  Contract negotiations from the late 1950s through the early 2000s are documented through minutes of the negotiations; issues of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Bargaining Bulletin</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Record</span>, and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Utility Workers' Light</span>; handbooks on mobilizing members; and surveys of union members regarding where they work and what issues in the contract are important to them.   </p><p> Materials related to strikes include correspondence, newsletters, notices, and posters regarding planning of strikes and positions taken by different political parties within the Local on the strike or possibility of the strike, as well as picket duty lists, schedules, and photographs of demonstrations and rallies.  The strikes that took place in the early 1990s are well documented through picket duty lists, schedules, and newsletters.   </p><p> Struggles between various political parties within the Local are documented through notices, posters, and newsletters, with a large portion documenting the clash between the Members 1st Party and the Justice Party over the trusteeship of the Local.  Other political parties represented include the New Directions Caucus, Administration, and the Unity Party.   </p>

  <div>
      <p> Boxes 1-3 of this collection are from a 1997 accession and were processed separately from boxes 4-10, which contain material from a 2003 accretion.  The material in the 2003 accretion was similar to the 1997 accession and was organized into the existing series, with the exception of Series V and VIII.  Material in the 2003 accretion that fell under Series V: Bargaining and Negotiation Records was further subdivided into different activities undertaken by Local 1-2:  negotiating contracts, settling grievance issues, negotiating mergers with other locals, and strikes.  Series VIII was created to incorporate materials documenting the attendance of Local 1-2 officers at national and regional conferences and conventions. Materials in boxes 11-14 were added to the collection in 2017. These materials have been incorporated into the intellectual arrangement of the collection. </p><p> Material that was intellectually arranged into the existing series was physically arranged after the 1997 accession and listed after it in the box list. </p><p> In 2014 the archived website was added as Series VII. </p>
