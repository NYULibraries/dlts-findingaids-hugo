MCH is a membership organization, and also has chapters based on buildings. MCH publishes The <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Tenant/Inquilino</span>and hosts a radio program on WBAI, "Listen to Housing Notebook."

The first two series of the collection consist of subject and administrative files created by the organization. Administrative files include executive board minutes, programs and ephemera from annual conferences, and records related to MCH's involvement in rent law reforms.

These files primarily relate to MCH lobbying campaigns and tenants' rights demonstrations. They include correspondence and administrative files related to MCH's work with other housing rights organizations in the city including the Cooper Square Committee, East Side Tenants Council, and the Riverside Edgecombe Neighborhood Association.

  <div>
      <p> Materials were donated by the Metropolitan Council on Housing in 1995, 2002, and 2008. Preliminary inventories were drafted in 2002 and 2008, which served as the basis for an online guide published in 2009. Sometime before 2007, some audio materials were separated from the collection. In 2013, the separated audio materials were returned to the collection, rehoused, and described. Four unrelated cassettes, including dubbed versions of commercial music recordings, were deaccessioned. In 2014, the archived websites were added as Series VI. In 2015, boxes 47 through 61 were removed and incorporated with the Cooper Square Committee Records (TAM 356) collection as its boxes 1 through 15. In 2016, Series V: 2014 Accretion was added to the collection. Additionally, the numbers of boxes in Series IV: 2008 and Series VI: Audio were updated to reflect the removal of materials transferred to the Cooper Square Committee Records. </p>
