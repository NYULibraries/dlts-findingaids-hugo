    <p>Gil Green (1906-1997) was a Communist, a Smith Act defendant, and a prominent figure in the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) through 1991. As a youth, he joined the Young Workers League (later the Young Communist League) eventually becoming its national secretary. From 1941-1945 and again from 1966-1968, Green was head of the Communist Party in New York State and also briefly headed the Party in Illinois. Convicted under the Smith Act in 1949, Green was imprisoned from 1956 until 1961. He left the Party in 1991 and helped to found the Committees of Correspondence. The Gil Green Papers date from 1949 to 1993 and include Green's correspondence, writings, and documentation of his political activities. The collection also contains a large amount of FBI files obtained by Green through Freedom of Information Act requests. These files relate primarily to the FBI's investigations of Green's work with the CPUSA and his prosecution under the Smith Act.</p></div>

Green sent an additional seven boxes of FBI files to the Tamiment Library in 1982. Additional FBI files were presumably sent to Tamiment sometime around 1993.

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Gil Green (1906-1997), born Gilbert Greenberg in Chicago, the son of working class Russian-Jewish immigrants, was a Communist youth leader in the 1930s, a member of the Communist Party's Politburo, a Smith Act defendant, and the chief figure of a reformist current in the CPUSA through 1991. Green joined the Young Workers League (later the Young Communist League) in 1924, and shortly thereafter, the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). He rose through the ranks, and in 1932 became national secretary of the YCL, a position he held throughout the decade. As secretary of the YCL he trained a generation of Party cadres and led the League to a position of influence in the 1.7 million-member American Youth Congress. In 1935 he attended the Comintern's Seventh Congress, where he was an advocate for the emerging Popular Front policy. In 1941 Green became head of the Party in New York State, but relinquished the title in 1945 due to his association with ousted Party head Earl Browder. Green later  moved to Chicago where he headed the Illinois Party organization. Convicted under the Smith Act in 1949, Green became a fugitive, surrendered in 1956 and was released from jail in 1961. In 1966, Green once again became the head of the New York Party, but resigned in 1968 to protest the CPUSA's endorsement of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He remained an elder statesman and locus of Communist Party reform currents until 1991, when he left the Party and helped to found the Committees of Correspondence, a social-democratic organization.  </p><p> Works by Gil Green: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">Marxism and the world today.</span>New York : New York State Committee, Communist Party, n.d. 23 p.</span><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">Youth confronts the Blue Eagle.</span>New York : Youth Publishers, November, 1933. 29 p.</span><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">United we stand : for peace and socialism.</span>New York : Workers Library Publishers, 1935. 63 p.</span><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">Young Communists and the unity of youth.</span>Speech delivered at the 7th World Congress of the Communist International.

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Gil Green Papers date from 1941 to 1993 and contain the correspondence, writings, and FBI files of Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) leader and organizer Gil Green. His papers consist primarily of correspondence and FBI files released through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Green corresponded with many like-minded communists, ex-communists, other U.S. leftists, historians, and researchers, and much of the correspondence in this collection relates to communist history and radical thought and activity. Several letters relate to Green's support of the Puerto Rican independence movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There is a small amount of personal correspondence between Green and his family, including photocopies of Green's correspondence during his five years in prison, 1956-1961. Green's prison correspondence largely consists of letters to his first wife (Lil Green, 1910-1964) and children, but also contains some letters with political associates and attorneys. The collection includes an assortment of unpublished typescripts, notes, and other materials related to Green's political career. Green's writing consist of speeches at Communist Party engagements, political essays and editorials, unpublished typescripts of books by Green and others, and several documents related to the publicity and reception of Green's books. A number of the FBI files in this collection were used by Green in preparation for his memoir, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Cold War Fugitive</span>, and were grouped by Green to facilitate his research. Green's FBI files make up the bulk of his collection and document government surveillance of his political activities from the late 1930s through the 1970s. The majority of these files focus on Green's affiliation with the CPUSA, the FBI's hunt for Green between 1949 and 1956, and his prison sentence. FBI files are accompanied by correspondence between Green, his attorney Edward Greer, and federal agencies regarding FOIA requests. </p>

  <div>
      <p> This collection was originally arranged into 5 series. In 2016, materials in Series I through Series III were consolidated and series numbers were updated to reflect this change. </p><p> Previously unprocessed materials in Series IV: FBI and Prison Files were processed in 2016. With the exception of a small portion of documents arranged by Green for personal research, these files had not been arranged. Before sending these materials to Tamiment, Green removed thousands of pages labeled "FOIPA Deleted Information Sheets," to reduce bulk, but retained the rest of the files largely as he had received them from the FBI. Titles for these files have been supplied by the archivist based on the FBI's general topic of inquiry; however, topics vary widely within certain files. </p>
