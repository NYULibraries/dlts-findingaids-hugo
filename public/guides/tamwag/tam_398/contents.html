      <p> This box mainly contains Price's correspondence with family and friends. The majority of the correspondence documents Price's World War II service, though many of the letters were written later and pertain to both his personal life and his various activism interests. Correspondents include Price's parents, his nephew George Jefferson Price III ("Jeff"), and Judith Gregory. Some of Price's World War II correspondence, along with news clippings and photographs from his service and clippings and publicity materials from the National Conference for New Politics, appear to have been collected by Price for a scrapbook. </p><p> This box also contains materials related to Price's journalism career, including reports and memoranda on changes at the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">National Guardian</span> and reports, correspondence, newsletters, and news clippings related to the work of the Newspaper Guild's Anti-Discrimination Committee. </p><p> Evidence of Price's activism in opposition to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) is also present in the form of news clippings on an April 1961 rally to abolish HUAC and memoranda, minutes, petitions, newsletters, press releases, and notes created by the National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee (NCAHUAC) and its local New York Council. Some of the materials document the fraught relationship between the national and New York groups. </p><p> To a much lesser extent, the box contains campaign material promoting the Progressive Party and Henry A. Wallace's 1948 run for president; First Amendment subject files on Arthur Miller and Otto Nathan containing news clippings, correspondence, and photographs; newsletters, correspondence, and reports produced by the American Veterans Committee (AVC), including a report written by Price for AVC titled "The Negro Doctor in Montclair and His Relationship to Montclair Hospitals;" documentation from a civil suit between Price and his siblings against their sister, Harriet Price; and correspondence and other material related to a family reunion Price helped organize in Oxford, New Jersey. </p>

      <p> About half of the materials in this box relate to housing rights issues. The materials document the work of the United Tenants Association (UTA), later the UTA/Mutual Housing Association-Housing Development Fund Corporation (UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc.), and other housing rights organizations during the 1970s through 1980s in the form of UTA Steering Committee minutes and UTA proposals, memoranda and correspondence, official statements, reports, and publicity materials, as well as collected news clippings. Many of the materials relate to the development plans for the West Side Urban Renewal Area (WSURA), particularly the UTA and the Strycker's Bay Neighborhood Council's interactions with Community Board #7 and the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) regarding WSURA. There is also material generated by the UTA Ad Hoc Committee for Low-Rent Housing, which documents the Ad Hoc Committee's opposition to the UTA/MHA program and the dispute between the Ad Hoc Committee and UTA/MHA-HDFC, Inc. Correspondence, legal documents, and other materials from the 1990s provide evidence of Price's dispute regarding the rehabilitation of his apartment under the Mutual Housing Association Program (MHAP).  </p><p> The other half of the box contains Price's correspondence and notes from Fire Island; legal documents and correspondence with lawyer Harry Rand and others regarding the U.S. v. Price First Amendment case; legal documents, photographs, and news clippings from the Price v. Kearney "Squad 47" wire tapping case; publicity materials, news clippings, and correspondence and memoranda documenting the activities of the New York Council to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee; what appear to be school notes; a brief working manuscript of Price's memoir written at age 60 and parts of his diary from 1940; subject files on the political climate in Israel, Egypt, Greece (including documents created by the American Committee for Democracy and Freedom in Greece), and Cuba (including a proposal for a photographers' trip to Cuba); and a miscellaneous assortment of correspondence, photographs, and news clippings relating to Price's personal life and various left-wing causes. </p>

      <p> This box mostly contains an assortment of collected reports, correspondence, news and scholarly articles (some written by Price), and other materials from a variety of sources collected by Price relating to the WSURA, racial discrimination in city planning, the urbanization of NYC, relocation, and public housing as a general issue.
