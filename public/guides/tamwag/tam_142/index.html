  <div>
      <p> James S. Allen (1906-1986), an organizer, Marxist scholar, writer and editor for the Communist Party, USA, was born Sol Auerbach in Philadelphia in 1906, the year his parents, Jacob and Luba, who were Russian Jewish radicals, came to the U.S. A doctoral candidate in philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, he traveled in 1927 with the first American student delegation to the Soviet Union. In 1928 he was expelled from college for his radical activities, joined the Communist Party and began writing for the <span class="ead-title">Daily Worker</span>, and edited the <span class="ead-title">Labor Defender</span>. In 1930, he took the pen name by which he became known and, with his wife Isabelle, founded and edited the <span class="ead-title">Southern Worker</span>, the first Communist weekly published in the South, which was circulated on an underground basis. As a member of the Party's Southern District committee, Allen played a prominent role in all of the CPUSA's major regional activities during the early 1930s; the organizing of Alabama sharecroppers, the Harlan, Kentucky miners' strike and the Scottsboro case.  </p><p> Three books by Allen, <span class="ead-title">The Negro Question in the United States</span> (1936), <span class="ead-title">Reconstruction: The Battle for Democracy</span> (1937), and <span class="ead-title">American Communism and Black Americans</span> (with Philip Foner, 1987), reflect his political concerns and southern experiences. By 1931, the strain of underground political work caused Allen to leave the South. In the late 1930s he was CPUSA representative in the Philippines, and a correspondent for The Nation (per a letter by editor Max Lerner), where he helped obtain the release of Communist prisoners and helped achieve the merger of the Communist and Socialist Parties. He served as foreign editor of the <span class="ead-title">Daily Worker</span> until being drafted in 1944. </p><p> During the Cold War years, he served as foreign editor of the Sunday Worker and was compelled to appear as a witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee. During the years 1958-1966, Allen was the secretary of the Party's National Program Committee, which was charged with developing a new program for the CPUSA, and he authored the initial drafts of the program, which was not published until 1970, and corresponded with prominent communists including Herbert Aptheker, William Z. Foster, John Howard Lawson, Pettis Perry and Al Richmond. From 1962 to 1972 Allen headed International Publishers, the CPUSA publishing house, having assisted his predecessor Alexander Trachtenberg, over the previous decades. He later served as U.S. editor of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels, a joint undertaking with English and Soviet publishers, corresponding with the British Marxist philosopher Maurice Cornforth. Allen also wrote several polemical books and pamphlets, including <span class="ead-title">Atomic Energy and Society</span> (1949), which elicited a signed letter from Albert Einstein, and several unpublished manuscripts, including a memoir titled "Visions and Revisions," a portion of which was posthumously published as <span class="ead-title">Organizing in the Depression South: A Communist's Memoir</span> (2001). </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">James Allen Bibliography : Books & Pamphlets </span> </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">American Communism and Black Americans : A Documentary History</span>, 1919-1929, edited by Philip S.
