    <p>In 1986, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) de-accessioned reference files from its Anne Rand Research Library pertaining to its rival, the New York-based International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), and donated them to the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University. The militant ILWU, representing West Coast longshoremen, had once been part of the ILA, but broke away during the bitter labor and political struggles of the mid-1930s. This contentious history forms the backdrop to the ILWU's amassing of extensive reference files on the ILA and its travails. The reference files include handbills, contracts, proceedings, internal documents, and newspaper clippings from the <span class="ead-title">New York Times</span>, the <span class="ead-title">Wall Street Journal</span>, the <span class="ead-title">Journal of Commerce</span>and other trade and labor papers – many of them documenting charges of fraud and racketeering on the New York City waterfront.</p></div>

      <p> In 1986, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union de-accessioned reference files from its Anne Rand Research Library pertaining to its rival, the New York-based International Longshoremen's Association, and donated them to the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University. The ILWU and its reference librarian, Carol Schwartz believed an East Coast location would better serve the research needs of scholars studying Atlantic and Gulf Coast maritime history. </p><p> As historian Gary Fink has written, "Longshoremen's unions on the West Coast had traditionally carried on a volatile relationship with the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA)." (Fink, Labor Unions, Greenwood Press, 1977, p.196) Despite fluctuating fortunes of West Coast locals, and a powerful employers association that dominated the industry until the mid-1930s, western longshoremen maintained an uneasy affiliation with the ILA until its conservative president, Joseph Ryan clashed openly with West Coast militants over issues that culminated in the historic San Francisco general Strike of 1934. When militant leader Harry Bridges was elected president of the San Francisco ILA local in 1934 (and later West Coast District president) a split became inevitable. In 1937 the Bridges group obtained a charter from the CIO for the International longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, representing Pacific Coast longshoremen. In the 1940s the two unions added to their ranks while keeping a wary eye on each other, until the ILWU fell afoul of Taft-Hartley Act anti-Communist provisions. Bridges became entangled in legal battles to avoid deportation to his native Australia, and the union found itself vulnerable to raids by the Teamsters and other rivals. At the same time, in the post-World war II period ILA members became increasingly dissatisfied with their leadership, and widespread charges of corruption brought an investigation of the union by the New York State Crime Commission. The result was inconclusive, but the American Federation of Labor demanded extensive reforms; when talks with the ILA broke down the AFL suspended the union and soon chartered a rival, the International Brotherhood of Longshoremen. The fledgling IBL failed make serious inroads in ILA membership, and the ILA reaffiliated to the AFL-CIO in 1959. </p><p> This contentious history forms the backdrop to the ILWU's amassing of extensive reference files on the ILA and its travails. This collection represents an unusual glimpse of a union's serious effort to monitor the fortunes of a rival labor organization -- in this case, a rival with which it had once been affiliated. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) reference files on the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) consist of 5 linear feet of "everything we could get our hands on about the ILA," according to the ILWU's librarian: handbills, contracts, proceedings, internal documents from negotiations, and newspaper clippings from the <span class="ead-title">New York Times</span>, the <span class="ead-title">Wall Street Journal</span>, the <span class="ead-title">Journal of Commerce</span>and other trade and labor papers. Of particular significance are the clippings files in Series II labeled "Crime and Racketeering" and "American Federation of Labor: Relations," which cover the proceedings of the New York State Crime Commission and the subsequent expulsion of the ILA from the AFL. Also of note are bargaining files ("Agreements, Negotiations"), files on strikes, and files on rank-and-file committees. </p><p> Several runs of serials, including the ILA's rank-and-file publication <span class="ead-title">Shape-Up</span>, have been removed from the collection and catalogued as part of the Tamiment Library. </p>
