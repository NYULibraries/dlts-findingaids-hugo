  <div>
      <p> The League for Industrial Democracy, also known as the LID, was founded in 1905 by such notables as Norman Thomas, Jack London and Clarence Darrow. The group, originally named the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, focused its attention primarily on educating college students about socialism and the labor movement. In 1921, the organization took on its current name. Still addressing students, the LID was home to what became the Students for a Democratic Society, then known as the Student League for Industrial Democracy. Taking a stance on communism became a divisive issue between the two groups. The organizations diverged following the Students for a Democratic Society's convention in Port Huron, Michigan in 1960. The LID continued to produce lecture and discussion guides as well as host conferences and study commissions to achieve their goal of increasing democracy in the economic, political, and cultural life. The organization also published numerous pamphlets on socialism, labor issues, totalitarianism and democracy. </p>
