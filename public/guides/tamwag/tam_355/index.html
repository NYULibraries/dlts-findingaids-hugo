    <p>B. D. Amis (1896-1993), was an African-American Communist and labor union organizer. He was a leader of the American Negro Labor Congress, the League of Struggle for Negro Rights, and the National Negro Congress, three Communist Party-inspired popular front organizations. He was a Party organizer for District Six, headquartered in Cleveland. He then moved to Philadelphia, where he was an organizer for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee and chairman of the Philadelphia Committee for the Defense of Ethiopia, and went on to organize Catering Industry Employees Union, Local 758, an African-American local within the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union (AFL), serving as Secretary-Treasurer of both organizations, ca. 1939-1942. The collection consists mostly of published and unpublished writings, many of them written for the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span>, for the monthly journal, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Communist</span>, or for the international Communist movement weekly, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">International Press Correspondence </span>(aka <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Inprecorr</span>). Also included are reports to various Communist Party national and local bodies, most of which are concerned with the struggle for African-American civil rights and the Communist Party's positions on civil rights issues. There are also clippings by and about Amis, correspondence, including a letter from African-American Communist leader Benjamin J. Davis, radio speeches, copies of photographs of Amis and of political meetings, and collective bargaining agreements signed by Amis.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> B. D. (B. DeWayne) Amis, 1896-1993, was an African-American Communist Party USA and labor union organizer. Amis was born in Chicago and by 1928 was president of the NAACP branch in Peoria, IL, when the Communist Party invited him to come to New York. Amis became a member of the National Committee of the Communist-inspired American Negro Labor Congress, and also wrote articles for the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span>, the party newspaper. In 1930, Amis became general secretary of the Communist-inspired League of Struggle for Negro Rights (LSNR) and an editor of its publication, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Liberator</span>. During this period Amis wrote the pamphlets <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Lynch Justice at Work</span> (1930) and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">They shall not die!: The story of Scottsboro in pictures</span> (1932). Amis went on to become the District Organizer for the Communist Party in Cleveland and traveled to the Soviet Union on two occasions, the second time for about a year and a half. While there, he took courses in Marxism and wrote articles for the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Negro Worke</span>r, the newspaper of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers. </p><p> Upon his return to the United States, Amis settled in Philadelphia where he joined the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) as a field organizer. He was also the head of the Philadelphia committee of the National Negro Congress, and the chairman of the Philadelphia Committee for the Defense of Ethiopia. He ran as the Communist candidate for Auditor General of Pennsylvania in 1936. He went on to organize Catering Industry Employees Union, Local 758, an African-American local of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union (AFL), serving as Secretary-Treasurer of both organizations, ca. 1939-1942. He subsequently worked for the Gulf Oil Company, while continuing his union and community organizing activities. Amis died in 1993. </p><p>  Sources:  </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">B. D. Amis - Black Communist and Labor Leader, by his son Barry D.
