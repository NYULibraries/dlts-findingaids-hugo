  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Communications Workers of America (CWA), founded in 1947 as an industrial union of telephone industry workers, was the culmination of nearly a half-century of struggle for telephone unionism. Its first president was Joseph A. Beirne, who had led its predecessor union, the National Federation of Telephone Workers (NFTW), in an organizing campaign and a nation-wide strike in 1946 that resulted in the first national agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). </p><p> During the next twenty-five years under the leadership Beirne, the CWA moved aggressively to organize all the telephone workers in the United States. It was not until 1974, however, after years of labor-management unrest and a series of strikes, that AT&T agreed to system-wide collective bargaining. Shortly after the national contract was signed, Joseph Beirne died and was replaced as President by Secretary-Treasurer Glenn E. Watts. In the 1960s, the CWA became an active participant in international labor activities supporting the United States government's Cold War policies through the union's involvement in organizations such as the CIA- and USAID (United States Agency for International Development)- financed American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD). </p><p> In the 1980s the CWA began to expand beyond telecommunications, creating a Public Employees Department that successfully organized 34,000 New Jersey state workers in 1981. In 1985 Morton Bahr became the CWA President. In 1987 the CWA merged with the International Typographical Workers Union. In 1992 it absorbed the National Association of Broadcast Employees and the Newspaper Guild merged with the CWA. By the 2000s the CWA had become one of the United States' largest and strongest unions with more than 600,000 members. </p>

  <div>
      <p> In January 2014, unprocessed addenda, as well as a portion of a videos collection and scrapbook, were integrated into the collection. To facilitate the incorporation of additonal photographs, slides, a scrapbook, and videos, the original ten series of the collection became subseries A-J of Series I: Photographic Prints.  Rolled photographs were treated by preservation staff in July 2014. 
Graphic and media materials separated from the original collection were integrated into Series I, Subseries IL, Addendum; and Series IV, Videos; February 2018 as Accession 2018.011. Accession 2018.024 was added to Subseries IL March 2018. </p>
