      <p> Upon receipt, the collection contained several distinct types of materials, but no consistent overall arrangement. Similar types of materials (i.e. playbills, scripts) were often grouped together, but not uniformly. The majority of materials were in folders, some of which had accurate titles, but were in no discernable order; other materials were loose and unfoldered. All materials were rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes, grouped into three series, and arranged alphabetically. Original folder titles were used, with descriptive clarifications as necessary, when present. When no original folder title existed, one was supplied by the archivist. Framed photographs were removed from their frames. </p>
