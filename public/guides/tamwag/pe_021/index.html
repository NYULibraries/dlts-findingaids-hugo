    <p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades. The collection consists of constitutions, by-laws, convention proceedings, press releases, reports and rosters as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, circular letters, newspapers clippings, pamphlets and other publications. The material ranges in date from 1949-2007 and generally comes from the AFL-CIO's national body as well as its various departments and committees. There is also material from the governing city, state and central federations of the AFL-CIO from around the country, notably from the New York State AFL-CIO. The collection also contains material from the New York City Central Labor Council, a labor membership organization for New York City unions.

  <div>
      <p> The AFL-CIO was formed when the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) merged in 1955. The AFL was formed in 1886 and was led by Samuel Gompers as a more traditional union that organized workers along craft lines. The CIO, initially a committee within the AFL called the Committee for Industrial Organization, broke away from the AFL in the late 1930s after disputes in how to organize all the workers of one industry into the same union. George Meany, the president of the AFL, was elected to serve as the first president of the newly merged AFL-CIO. He was succeeded by Lane Kirkland in 1979. As a voluntary federation of international labor unions, the AFL-CIO represents nearly all unionized employees in the United States and Canada. The AFL-CIO lobbies on behalf of organized labor and mediates disputes between member unions. It holds quadrennial conventions and member unions are proportionately represented with delegates who attend and vote. John Sweeney was elected as president in 1995, this was the AFL-CIO's first contested election. When Sweeney retired in 2009, Richard Trumka, of the United Mine Workers of America was elected president. </p>
