    <p>The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), District Council 1707 Records document the administrative functions of Local 1707/DC 1707 (formerly the Community and Social Agency Employees Union). The Council's jurisdiction covers many categories of employees in private-sector social service agencies. Much of the material in the collection relates to the Council's dealings with agencies where Council members are employed (e.g. bargaining files, contracts, grievance files); the collection also contains Executive Board and Delegate Assembly meeting files; general administrative files for DC 1707, and its locals, committees, and chapters; records of some officers and staff; publications and publicity files; general subject files; as well as photographs and other media formats.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> District Council 1707 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) is the only council within AFSCME that is chartered exclusively to represent private, nonprofit employees. It currently represents about 25,000 workers throughout the New York City area (and New York State), including those within private sector fundraising and advocacy agencies, case work and group work agencies, teaching and related organizations, child care centers, home care services, and Head Start programs. In addition to advocating for better wages, benefits and conditions for employees within these various workplaces, the Council has worked to improve and expand social services in a number of areas. Many Council members work in government-funded private agencies and centers, and, through its Legislative Committee and other advocacy efforts, it has strenuously opposed city and state budget cuts. DC 1707 has also been a strong advocate for children's welfare since it first began organizing (subsidized) day-care centers in the late 1960s. </p><p> The Council began in 1932 as the Association of Federation Workers, a staff association within the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. Over the ensuing decades, the association had several names and affiliations, including the Community and Social Agency Employees (CSAE), Local 1707. Local 1707 joined the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), District Council 37 in 1955, following the merger of the AFL and the CIO. </p><p> Local 1707 outgrew its single local structure by the early 1970s, as a result of growth in membership and its presence in increasingly diverse agencies. A membership referendum approved the establishment of District Council 1707 within AFSCME in December 1973 -- the culmination of a process which took several months. The first DC 1707 officers were nominated and elected in April 1974. </p><p> As of 2010, the Council consists of: Local 95 Head Start Employees, Local 107 National Membership and Fund Raising Employees, Local 205 Day Care Employees, Local 215 Social Service Employees, Local 253 Education Employees, Local 389 Home Care Employees, Local 1881 Association of Professional Personnel (Development Corporation for the State of Israel Bonds), and a Retirees Chapter. </p><p> DC 1707 also has various committees including the Political Action Committee, the Latino Committee, the Women's Committee, and the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU) Committee. The union has been active throughout its history in advocating for civil rights and has encouraged the political involvement of its membership. </p><p> Among the Executive Directors of Local 1707 were Hilda Siff, Shirley Kera, and Benjamin Bially (1963-1968). Executive Director Richard Morton (1970-1984) oversaw the Local's restructuring into a district council. He was followed by Robert McEnroe (1985-1994) and Josephine LeBeau (1994-2002). Raglan George, Jr. became Executive Director of DC 1707 in 2002, after serving the Council in a number of capacities, including Director of Local 95 and Local 205. </p>
