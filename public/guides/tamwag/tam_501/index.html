  <div>
      <p> John Penley is a photographer and grassroots political activist associated with the squatters' rights movement and housing protests of the 1980s and 1990s in New York City's East Village and Lower East Side, as well as numerous other social causes. A former Navy serviceman, Penley took up photography as part of an effort to document the demonstrations, protests, and other political actions in which he took part, and in the process became a photojournalist. Hundreds of Penley's photographs have appeared in in publications including the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Daily News</span>, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Post</span>, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Times</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York and Long Island Newsday</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Magazine</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Villager</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">High Times Magazine</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Art In America</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">WW 3 Illustrated</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Shadow</span>, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">East Village Eye</span>, and many small political publications. They have also been distributed through press services such as United Press International and the Associated Press. </p>

Other social issues addressed by Penley's photographs include AIDS and gay rights activism and activism against police brutality, the death penalty, and racial hate crimes and discrimination. To a lesser extent, the collection also contains magazine and newspaper clippings that feature Penley's photographs, leaflets and handbills related to the squatters' rights movement, and legal documents concerning Penley's 1982 and 1987 arrests. An additional set of photographs taken 2009-2013 also contains images relating to life in the Lower East Side as well as Occupy Wall Street and protests in support of Chelsea Manning and Wikileaks. </p>

  <div>
      <p> In 2009, a group of color slides from which images were selected to be displayed in the Tamiment Library's flickr exhibit of John Penley's images were rehoused into paper sleeves or envelopes and placed in three record cartons.  John Penley wrote descriptions of the events or subjects on the majority of the sleeves.  Most of the sleeves in this group are un-numbered except for those shoots from which images drawn for the flickr exhibit. Those shoots have numbers written on their sleeves and these same shoot numbers are displayed with the captions for the images from them in the flickr exhibit.  Researchers should note that additional images from the same shoots and events found in the flickr exhibit may also be found in shoots with similar captions and dates throughout the rest of the collection. </p><p> In 2013, the remaining photographic materials in the collection were removed from their original housing and rehoused in archival quality boxes, folders, and sleeves. John Penley provided description for much of the collection during this rehousing, and his descriptions, which often include  subjective and evaluative information, constitute the folder-level titles in Series II of the collection. However, researchers should note that not all of the collection was described during this process. </p><p> Photographs and negatives from discrete events or subjects were originally housed together in their own envelopes or other containers in several record cartons. The archivists assigned each envelope or other container a sequential three-digit number, followed by either the suffix "-P" for prints or suffix "-N" for negatives. For example, negatives from an original envelope might be assigned the number "001-N" and any prints from that same envelope would be assigned the number "001-P." Standard-size photographs were rehoused in photograph boxes and were separated by tabs with the identifying number and suffix written on them. Oversize photographs were rehoused in archival folders and placed in record cartons, with the identifying number and suffix written on the folders. Negatives were rehoused in paper sleeves and placed in negative boxes, with the identifying number and suffix written on the sleeves. </p><p> When only prints or only negatives were housed within their own envelope or other container, the materials were assigned their own number and suffix, without a corresponding number for the other photographic format. For example, if any envelope contained only negatives and no prints, the negatives might be assigned the number "002-N," but "002-P" would not exist, which explains why there are gaps in the numbering within the record cartons and photograph and negative boxes. </p><p> Photographs and negatives which were loose in the original record cartons (not housed in their own envelopes or other containers) were assigned their own number using the same numbering system, but also include the following in brackets: "[Loose from box X]" (with "box X" indicating the original record carton number). </p><p> Any descriptive information written on the original envelopes or containers was retained. The archivists either wrote this information on the dividing tabs, folders, or sleeves or photocopied or cut out the information from the original envelope and placed the clipping within the folders or in front of the dividing tab or sleeve. </p><p> Slides have been removed from their original containers and rehoused in archival quality slide boxes. Slides have been numbered using the same alphanumeric numbering system as the prints and negatives (001-S, 002-S, etc.) and tabs have been used within each slide box to indicate the original groupings of the slides. The numbering for the slides is separate from the numbering for the other photographic materials; that is, the numbers from the slides' alphanumeric codes do not correlate to the numbering used for the prints and negatives (the slides that comprise 001-S are not from the same shoot as 001-N and 001-P). </p><p> John Penley's papers and photographs were initially established as separate collections: the John Penley Photographs (PHOTOS 268) and the John Penley Papers (TAM 501). In 2013, the photograph collection was incorporated into the paper collection, forming the John Penley Photographs and Papers (TAM 501). </p><p> In 2014, the archived website was added as Series III. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Arrangement note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection has been arranged into two series:<br>
Series I: Papers, circa 1980-2010<br>
Series II: Photographs, circa 1980-2013 </p><p> Series I is organized alphabetically by folder title. Series II is physically arranged by format and intellectually arranged sequentially by an archivist-supplied alphanumeric code indicating a discrete event or photo shoot. For more information on this arrangement system, please refer to the Processing Information Note. The subseries John Penley 2013 Donation was included in series II to reflect additional material incorporated into the collection in 2013. </p>
