      <p> Victor Navasky, highly regarded journalist, editor, author and educator, is best known for his close association with <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Nation</span>, America's longest continuously published weekly magazine.  He was its editor from 1978-1995, publisher and editorial director from 1995-2005, and is now publisher emeritus. He has also written a number of award-winning books and contributed articles and reviews to numerous magazines and journals. Navasky is Professor of Journalism and Director of the George Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism at Columbia University and serves as Chairman of the Columbia Journalism Review. </p><p> Victor Navasky was born in New York City on July 5, 1932, the son of Macy Navasky and Esther (Goldberg) Navasky.  His father ran a small clothing manufacturing business in the Garment District.  From kindergarten through fifth grade, Navasky attended the Rudolf Steiner School and then the progressive Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School.  After graduating in 1950, he went on to Swarthmore, where he earned Phi Beta Kappa honors and a degree in 1954.  His majors were English Literature and Political Science, with a minor in Philosophy. A stint in the Army followed (1954-1956).  He was stationed at Fort Richardson in Alaska.   </p><p> After his military service, Navasky took advantage of the GI Bill to enroll at Yale Law School, earning his LLB in 1959.  While at Yale, he and a friend, Richard Lingeman, started a magazine of political satire, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Monocle</span>, which they continued through mail subscription after graduation.  They also published <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Outsider's Newsletter </span>and then <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Radical Sporadical</span>, with the last issue in 1965. </p><p> Navasky worked for a short time as a speechwriter for G. Mennen Williams, then governor of Michigan, and, after moving back to New York in 1960, began freelance writing for various publications, principally for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The New York Times Magazine</span> where he became an editor in 1970.   In 1971 Navasky published <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Kennedy Justice</span>, an account of Robert Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General.  It was a finalist for the 1972 National Book Award.  By that time he had started a new book, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names</span>, the outgrowth of an article on the Hollywood Ten that he wrote earlier for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The New York Times Magazine</span>.  <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names </span>would be published in 1980 and win the National Book Award in 1982. </p><p> During the 1970s, while working on  <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names</span>, Navasky coordinated the New York senatorial campaign of Ramsey Clark, wrote a monthly column ("In Cold Print") for the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Times Book Review</span>, and taught for a time at New York University in its adult education program, as well as at a number of other colleges and universities. One course, for example, at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, focused on informers and cooperative witnesses.  Navasky was the Ferris Visiting Professor of Journalism at Princeton (1976-1977). </p><p> In 1978, Victor Navasky became editor of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Nation </span> and, in 1995, its publisher and editorial director.  Those responsibilities were handed over to Katrina vanden Heuvel in 2005, and Navasky became publisher emeritus.   </p><p> In 1984, Navasky (with Christopher Cerf) published <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Experts Speak: The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation</span> and, in 2008, in a similar vein, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Mission Accomplished! Or How We Won the War in Iraq</span>, each book a compilation of the collective wisdom of many individuals presumed to know what they talking about, but who get it very wrong.  Navasky won a George Polk Book Award in 2005 for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">A Matter of Opinion</span>, part memoir and part meditation on opinion journalism.  He released <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Art of Controversy: Political Cartoons and Their Enduring Power</span> in 2013.  His most recent publication is an eBook, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The O'Dell File</span> (2014). </p><p> Victor Navasky has been married since 1966 to Anne (Strongin) Navasky.  They live in New York City and have two daughters, Miri and Jenny, and a son, Bruno. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection provides a broad view of Victor Navasky's life, his interests, and his work.  It contains personal items from as early as his time in the third grade at the Rudolf Steiner School, as well as school and military records, family correspondence, and samples of his earliest writings.  Material in the collection describes his first venture as an editor and publisher with the satirical journal, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Monocle</span>, and recounts the history of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Nation</span> and Navasky's association with the magazine.  Among the books he has written or co-authored, three warranted individual series in the collection -- <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names</span> (Viking Press, 1980); <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">A Matter of Opinion</span> (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005); and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Art of Controversy </span> (Knopf, 2013).  Each of these series contains extensive research material and varied products of Navasky's writing process, such as notes, outlines, drafts, typescripts and galley proofs.  Much of his other work is represented in the series "Other Navasky Writings," including his first book – <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Kennedy Justice</span> (Atheneum, 1971).  The series also contains articles, essays, plays, and speeches, some with background research and other relevant items.  There are materials drawn from Navasky's continuing career at Columbia University and, also, a large series containing a wide range of subject files representing either research for books, articles, speeches, or lectures, or merely items collected based on Navasky's personal interests.  </p><p> Correspondence appears across the collection, in almost every series.  Among the varied items are personal letters; communications with research sources and subjects, and with writers, publishers, editors and others involved in Navasky's many projects and activities.  There is also <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Nation</span> correspondence, both internal and external.  Correspondents include many who are well-known, such as William F. Buckley, John Henry Faulk, Henry Kissinger, Molly Ivins, Anthony Lewis, Gus Hall, Elie Wiesel, Merle Miller, Sally and Cedric Belfrage, Hal Holbrook, and Merle Miller.   There is also correspondence to which Victor Navasky is not a party.  Examples include exchanges involving Albert Maltz, Dalton Trumbo, and Ring Lardner Jr.; also between Alice Orans and Frank Donner.  Among the highlights are photocopies of many letters written to early editors of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Nation</span> from such notables as Clarence Darrow, John Maynard Keynes, Felix Frankfurter, H.L. Mencken, Franklin Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, Cordell Hull, and many others. </p><p> Some of the topics and individuals may be found across multiple series.  Navasky's association with <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Nation</span>, for example, has its own series but related materials also form a large part of the research for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">A Matter of Opinion</span>, and references to <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Nation</span> appear in other series as well.   Similarly, materials concerning Alger Hiss can be found in numerous places.  Although there are brief mentions in the series for the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Monocle</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names</span>, most is to be found in materials associated with <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">A Matter of Opinion </span> and in the subseries "Articles and Essays – Alger Hiss".  There are also Hiss items and research on Soviet espionage in "Subject Files". The Rosenberg Case, another of Navasky's long-time investigative interests, appears in research files for both <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">A Matter of Opinion</span>; in the articles subseries (a 1975 book review of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">We Are your Sons</span>); in subject files; and in the audio-visual material.  Among other individuals who may be found across series are Carey McWilliams (<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names</span>, as well as<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic"> A Matter of Opinion</span>,) John Henry Faulk, Christopher Hitchens, and Alexander Cockburn. Researchers interested in a specific topic or individual should search across all series.   </p><p> The collection contains significant audio-visual material.  Of particular interest are audio recordings of a number of interviews Victor Navasky conducted for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Naming Names</span> and a special event sponsored by The Nation Institute, "A Conversation with I.F. Stone at 80." </p><p> Papers added to the collection in 2016 consist of 22 boxes of drafts, correspondence, administrative files, and research related to Navasky's work at the Columbia School of Journalism and his publications. Columbia School of Journalism materials include teaching files and course design materials, including correspondence with public intellectuals he invited to his classes as guest lecturers. These materials also include files related to the operation of two Columbia University publications, which were edited by Navasky, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Columbia Journalism Review</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The New York Review of Magazines</span>. Other materials related to Navasky's work at Columbia include correspondence and administrative files related the organization of the Delacorte Lecture Series 2001-2008, and transcripts of Delacorte lectures 2000-2013. It also contains significant materials related to Navasky's research on Alger Hiss. The bulk of these files include research related to the 1996 release of the Venona Papers and include correspondence with journalists and scholars about the revelations, copies articles, notes, and drafts of Navasky's writing about Venona. They also include several files related to the website The Alger Hiss Project, which was created in 2001 through grants from the Nation Institute. Additionally this donation includes some personal materials from Navasky's adolescence, organizational files from the Monocle, and five boxes of research files compiled between the 1990s and 2008. Many of the research files relate topics covered in other series and include copies of articles, drafts, notes, and correspondence. </p>

  <div>
      <p> Upon receipt, the collection had no consistent overall arrangement, although there were numerous groupings of related material.  Several file structures existed such as Navasky's "New Nation" file and a large sequential file focused on opinion journalism.   The folders in these groups were not always contiguous.  There were several sections of folders that were somewhat alphabetical.  Many boxes contained loose material, some unfoldered, while the content of others was clearly arranged and labeled.    Related items were often found scattered throughout the boxes, with pockets of discernable organization.  These were physically and intellectually brought together and described. A series arrangement was imposed by the archivist based on aggregation of materials with similar titles and related content, creating individual series for major aspects of Navasky's career and for his published  works that are most strongly represented in the collection.   Original folder titles were used to the extent possible.  Clarification was added as necessary.  In addition to the arrangement and descriptive work, a number of items required cleaning.  Fragile material was photocopied.  The collection was rehoused in acid-free folders. Appropriately sized boxes were utilized for oversized materials some of which had been folded and compressed. </p><p> In 2016 an additional 22 boxes were incorporated into the collection. The majority of these papers were housed in hanging files and roughly grouped by topic. Materials from this donation were rehoused in archival boxes and folders and renumbered 95-116. The order of the original boxes was slightly altered to unite files on similar topics, but materials within boxes have not been rearranged. Original folders and titles were retained where possible, but the majority of titles were supplied by the archivist. The majority of these files have been incorporated into the existing arrangement of the collection and described by general topics at the box level. Five boxes of research files, which are grouped in roughly chronological order from the 1990s to 2008 and touch on a variety of topics, have been added to Series IX: Subject files as Research Files from 2016 Accretion. Electronic records from the 2016 accretion have been identified and inventoried, but have not been forensically imaged, analyzed, or described individually in the finding aid. </p><p> In 2017 materials from a 2016 donation were added as a new series, Series XI:2017 Accession, and described at the series-level. At the time of accessioning paper records were moved to a separate box from audio visual materials, and A/V extents were recorded. Digital materials recorded on DVD-R were inventoried but have not been forensically imaged. </p>
