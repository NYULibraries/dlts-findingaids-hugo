    <p>John Dollard (1900-1980) was a psychologist and social scientist best known for his studies on race relations in America. From 1942 to 1945 he served as a consultant in the Morale Services Division the United States Department of War, during which time he and fellow psychologists at Yale University's Institute of Human Relations produced a study titled "Fear and Courage under Battle Conditions." This study investigated fear and morale of soldiers in modern combat conditions. With the active assistance of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade interviews with Lincoln Brigade veterans were carried out and a questionnaire distributed. Three hundred veterans who had served as volunteers with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War replied and became the research subjects for the study. The collection consists of some research files of Dr. John Dollard and his staff.  Included are fourteen interview transcripts, two completed questionnaires,  a correspondence file, a published version of the project report, and some clippings and publicity material.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> John Dollard (1900-1980) was a psychologist and social scientist best known for his studies on race relations in America. He received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago in 1931 and in 1932 was appointed Research Associate in Social Anthropology at Yale University's Institute of Human Relations, where he conducted some of his most influential work. From 1942 to 1945 Dollard served as Expert Consultant to the Morale Services Division of the United States Department of War. Beginning in 1941 he and Neal E.Miller, Research Associate in Psychology at the Institute, undertook a study a study of fear and morale in modern combat conditions. When Miller enlisted soon after Pearl Harbor, John Dollard completed the study, working with Dr. Donald Harrison of the Institute, and with considerable assistance from the Irving Fajans, Jack Bzoje and other members of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  Lincoln veteran John V. Murra, then a graduate student in anthropology at the university of Chicago and later a distinguished anthropologist, acted as a paid project assistant, helping with the distribution and collection of project materials, and traveling to Detroit and other cities to secure cooperation from veterans.  </p><p> As a preliminary to designing the study's questionnaire some interviews with veterans were conducted by project staff. The 44-page questionnaire was then distributed to men (and at least one woman?) who had served under fire as American volunteers in the Spanish Civil War. Three hundred Lincoln Brigade veterans returned the lengthy questionnaire.  With the aid of a Rockefeller Foundation grant Dollard and his team summarized their findings in a report entitled <span class="ead-title">Fear and Courage under Battle Conditions</span>(1943), a statistical analysis of the veterans' replies.  The report was published as <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Fear in Battle</span> (Washington: The Infantry Journal, 1944).  In 1952 Dollard became a professor in Yale University's Department of Psychology and in 1969 he retired with the title professor emeritus. </p>
