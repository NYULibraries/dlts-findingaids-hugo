  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Cormac Kevin Hooker O'Malley was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1942. His father was Ernie O'Malley (1897-1957), Irish revolutionary, author and patron of the arts, and his mother was American artist and socialite Helen Huntington Hooker (1905-1993). Upon the death of his father, O'Malley left Ireland to finish his education in the United States, obtaining a BA from Harvard in 1965 and a JD from Columbia University in 1970. He pursued a career in international law in New York, first with Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, then, from 1981 with Bristol-Myers, living in Mexico, Brussels, London, and New York according to the dictates of his career. In the 1990s, upon retirement from Bristol-Myers Squibb, O'Malley became active as an advisor to Glucksman Ireland House at New York University. </p><p> When in New York, O'Malley was involved with the Irish American community, joining various cultural, academic, and social organizations, such as the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in the City of New York, the American Committee (later Conference) for Irish Studies, and the Irish Arts Center in New York. During the 1970s-1980s, O'Malley served as an officer or on the board of four such groups: the American Irish Historical Society, the Irish American National Bicentennial Committee, the Ireland Fund (now the American Ireland Fund) and the National University of Ireland Club. O'Malley also had an interest in the civil rights struggle in Northern Ireland. From 1971-1978 he served as national coordinator for the American Committee for Ulster Justice, a group of Irish American lawyers and activists intent on eliminating anti-Catholic discrimination and exposing British complicity in the region's conflict. </p><p> O'Malley is the author of "The Publication History of <span class="ead-title">On Another Man's Wound</span>" in <span class="ead-title">New Hibernia Review</span>7:3 (2003): 136-139 and co-author with Keith Highet of <span class="ead-title">Current Aspects of Doing Business in Black Africa</span>(American Bar Association, 1975). </p>

  <div>
      <p> In 1980 Cormac O'Malley deposited 27 cubic feet of material in the archives of St. John's University in Jamaica, New York. It remained unprocessed and unused for the next 20 years. In December 2000, while President of the Board of Advisors for New York University's Glucksman Ireland House, O'Malley transferred the collection to the Archives of Irish America at the Tamiment Library as a permanent donation.  Approximately 20 linear feet of materials were initially transferred in December 2005 and an additional 7 linear feet were transferred in March 2001.  The accession number associated with this donation is 2000.025.  A 2015 accrual (2015.047) from Glucksman Ireland House added 8.5 linear feet that were incorporated into the collection as Subseries IF and an addition to Series III.  A 2016 accretion (2016.069) from Glucksman Ireland House added 6 linear feet that were incorporated into the collection as Subseries IG, Subseries IH, Subseries II, Subseries IJ, and an addition to Subseries ID. </p>
