    <p>Morris U. Schappes (1907-2004) was a scholar, editor and activist who was fired by the City College of New York after being investigated as a Communist Party member, and who spent over a year in prison (1943-1944) for perjury after refusing to name other Party members when testifying before an investigating committee of the New York State Legislature. He was a founder and longtime editor of the progressive, secular magazine <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span>; a popular lecturer;  and the author of articles, reviews, radio broadcasts, books and monographs, many of them on U.S. Jewish history. This collection contains correspondence, published and unpublished writings, clippings and other printed ephemera, photographs, research materials and documents produced by various progressive organizations.  In addition, there is a considerable quantity of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span> editorial correspondence, Editorial Board minutes and administrative files.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Morris U. Schappes (1907-2004) was a scholar, editor and activist who was fired by the City College of New York after being investigated as a Communist Party member, and who spent over a year in prison (1943-1944) for perjury after refusing to name other Party members when testifying before an investigating committee of the New York State Legislature. He was a founder and long-time editor of the progressive, secular magazine <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span>; a popular lecturer;  and the author of articles, reviews, radio broadcasts, books and monographs, many of them on U.S. Jewish history.  </p><p> Born Moishe Shapshilevich in Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine, Schappes spent his earliest years in Brazil and then moved with his parents to New York City in 1914.  Bureaucrats reduced the family name to Schappes and his mother Americanized his name as Morris.  He added the middle "U" later as part of his byline as a sportswriter on the newspaper of City College of New York (CCNY), where he graduated in 1928 and subsequently joined the faculty as an English lecturer. (He had previously attended Townsend Harris Hall High School.)  He also attended Columbia University as a graduate student, earning a master's degree in 1930.  In that same year, he began his sixty-two year marriage to Sonya Laffer, who died in 1992. </p><p> A longtime fixture in the world of American Communism, Schappes gained widespread attention in 1941 when he was fired, along with 40 others, from the faculty of CCNY for Communist Party membership or involvement.  The school had first attempted to dismiss him in 1936 for his political activities but he was retained as the result of a student protest.  Later he served 13 1/2 months (1943-1944) in prison for perjury after refusing to name other Party members before New York's Joint Legislative Committee on the State Education System (known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee).  After his release from prison, Schappes worked briefly in a war production factory in Queens and, in 1946, joined with other Party activists to found the magazine <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Life</span>, which became an unofficial Party organ.  He supplemented his income by freelance lecturing and writing. </p><p> As a scholar, Schappes first achieved some prominence for his work on the poetry and letters of Emma Lazarus, and he published a number of books and monographs between 1944 and 1987.  Having developed a strong interest in Jewish history while serving in prison, he subsequently published two broad historical studies: <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">A Documentary History of the Jews in the United States, 1654-1877</span> (1950) and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Jews in the United States: A Pictorial History, 1654 to the Present</span> (1958).   </p><p> In the early 1950s, Schappes experienced another brush with government committees when the State Department began a purge of books from the shelves of overseas libraries operated by the United States Information Agency.  The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, held hearings to support McCarthy's demand that 30,000 "Communist books" be removed, including Schappes' <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">A Documentary History of the Jews…</span>. In April of 1953, Schappes was subpoenaed and appeared before the committee to defend his books and to attack McCarthyism. </p><p> After Nikita Krushchev's 1956 speech denouncing the misdeeds of Stalin, the subscription base of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Life</span> began slipping away and the magazine's staff joined many of the rank-and-filers in their disillusion with the Communism they had known.  The result was the founding of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span>, with Morris Schappes as its editor; the journal, independent of Party discipline and financing, would become an intellectual home for an increasingly diverse base of (mostly) secular Jewish leftists. </p><p> Schappes dedicated more than four decades to <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span>, and to shaping the views of its enthusiastic and loyal readership. In his "Editor's Diary" column, he reported on books, plays, films and events in the progressive Jewish movement and engaged in a number of  noteworthy controversies, including a historical defense of American Jewish responses to the Holocaust; commentaries about solidarity and tensions between U.S. Jews and African-Americans; and his concerns about antisemitism in Shakespeare's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>.  Schappes played  an active role in the day-to-day management of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span> until 2000. </p><p> Throughout his working life, he was a sought-after lecturer and commentator on Jewish affairs and wrote many articles, essays and letters to the editor in a variety of newspapers, magazines and journals.  In 1981, the faculty senate of City College formally apologized for firing him and his colleagues. </p><p> Morris Schappes died in New York City on June 3, 2004.  He was 97 years old. </p><p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Schappes donations spanned a number of years and there had been several attempts to 'arrange' the earlier materials.  Also, at the time of the final donation (after Schappes' death), the removal of materials from his apartment had to be done quickly and accomplished jointly with staff from the American Jewish Historical Society, who were also to receive some of the items.  Under these circimstances, maintaining any significant original order would have been difficult.  In addition, much of the material (from all donations) lacked organization, was not in folders and had been randomly placed in boxes.<br><br> 
One characteristic of Schappes' files was his creation of individual packets of material which were scattered throughout the collection.   He often used clips to hold together related items rather than placing them in folders.  For example, an incoming letter or an article of interest would be accompanied by additional research and correspondence, hand written notes and, perhaps, an event flyer or list of citations. In processing the collection, these packets of material were kept together and, in most cases, formed the basis of a titled folder.  For materials that were already contained within folders, the original titles were retained to the extent possible.<br><br>
Correspondence appears in many parts of the collection and, in the case of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span> correspondence, much of the original order was maintained even though magazine's staff over the years had changed its arrangement scheme from alphabetic by correspondent name to chronological.  There are sections of each, as well as specific groups of correspondence such as rejection letters sent to individuals whose submissions to the magazine were not accepted for publication.<br><br>
A series arrangement was imposed based on the aggregation of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jewish Currents</span> files, identification of personal items and biographical material, and creation of a very large section of subject files reflecting Schappes'  wide variety of interests and activities.  WBAI broadcast materials and audio files were placed in separate series. </p><p> Photographs were separated from this collection during initial processing and were established as a separate collection, the Morris Schappes Photographs (PHOTOS 154). In 2014, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the Morris Schappes Papers. </p>

The 1968 donation is especially relevant as it focuses on Schappes' dealings with the Rapp-Coudert Committee and his time in prison, represented by court documents, trial notes, pamphlets, newspaper articles, press releases, and prison rules and regulations. Of particular interest is the correspondence, which includes many letters of support written during his legal battles and prison correspondence with his friends, with servicemen (1943-1946), and with his wife, Sonya.  The remainder of the collection consists of materials Schappes generated and collected between 1931 and 1990 in connection with his professional work as a scholar, writer and editor.
