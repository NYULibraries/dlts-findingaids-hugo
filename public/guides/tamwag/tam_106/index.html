    <p>Betty Friedan founded the National Organization for Women in Washington, D.C. in 1966 to "bring women into the mainstream of American society."

The collection includes: board, membership and committee minutes, officers' files, treasurer's reports, resumes, chapter newsletters, committee newsletters, newspapers, press clippings, photocopies of articles, pamphlets, film scripts, audio recordings, photographs, negatives, slides, flyers, leaflets, posters, membership lists, press releases, government publications, court decisions, financial statements, magazines, and an archived version of the New York chapter website, http://nownyc.org/.

Other subject files include child care, legislation and politics. Correspondents include: Bella Abzug, Martha Griffins, Gloria Steinem, Patsy Mink, Edward Muskie, Ed Koch, George McGovern, John Dean III, Jacob Javits, Shirley Chisholm and John Brademas.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> In 1966, Betty Friedan founded the National Organization for Women in Washington, D.C., a group whose goal was to "bring women into the mainstream of American society." Three years earlier, her book <span class="ead-title">The Feminine Mystique</span> had hit a nerve with American women (largely white, upper class women), whose discontent with their economic and social opportunities would result in the feminist social activism of the 1960s and 1970s. Not long after the national organization was formed, the New York Chapter was founded in 1967. It was the founding chapter and, arguably in its early days, the most influential chapter, as its victories in New York rippled out into the rest of the country. The motivating force for its early organizing efforts was largely related to employment discrimination in hiring practices and discrepancy in wages between men and women--one of NOW-N.Y.C.'s early victories was the elimination of sex-segregated help-wanted advertisements in the <span class="ead-title">New York Times</span>. However, from its inception, the group was multi-issue, functioning through a committee structure that included committees on the arts, child care, education, employment, the image of women in the media, legislation and politics, reproductive rights, and sexuality. </p><p> NOW-N.Y.C. sponsored large-scale marches and strikes, such as the well-known "Women Strike for Equality" march August 26, 1970 in New York City, which became an annual event for NOW for several years. Early on the group focused on media-attention-getting tactics to make its relatively small ranks look larger, such as the "flush-in" outside the offices of Colgate-Palmolive to protest discrimination in hiring practices. The organization also used such mainstream democratic tactics as lobbying legislators, collecting petitions, and sending mass mailings to the White House to put pressure on government officials. The chapter participated in an annual state lobby day with NOW-New York State. In the 1980s, NOW created a group called WomanPower PAC, a political action committee formed to raise money to elect women and feminist leaders to elected office. The first four presidents of NOW-NYC were Jean Faust, Ti Grace Atkinson, Ivy Bottini and Jacqueline Ceballos (the latter in 1971). </p><p> The Education Committee studied the course offerings of girls and boys in New York public schools in the 1970s, and its report was so much in demand, it went into four printings. New York schools and schools across the country began changing their course offerings as a result of this committee's work. In the mid-seventies it began addressing the issue of rape, and its Rape Prevention Committee was one of the first of its kind, offering myriad services to victims of rape and battery and changing the public perception of rape and rape victims. In the late 1970s and 1980s, NOW-N.Y.C.'s employment focus broadened to include career-training workshops and referral services for employers. </p><p> The struggle for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment began in the early 1970s and gained momentum throughout the decade. In the years before the deadline for ratification, the issue took center stage for NOW-N.Y.C., and the ERA Committee reached out to other states to aid in the battles for ratification in state legislatures. In the areas of the arts and the image of women in the media, NOW fought for a dignified representation of women. The group's Image Committee influenced changes in print media advertising, and the Arts Committee called attention to the discrimination against women in the art world. The organization continues its mission of equality for women in New York City. For information on the actions, events, and tactics of the committees, please see the descriptions below each committee heading. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Photographs, ephemera, artifacts, and audio had been removed from this collection during initial processing and established as the National Organization for Women: New York City Chapter Photographs (PHOTOS 081) and the National Organization for Women: New York City Chapter Oral History Collection (OH 044).  Posters had been separated and integrated into the Tamiment/Wagner Poster Collection (GRAPHICS 002) in the subseries US56.2/Women/National Organization for Women.  Additionally, audiovisual materials were separated and integrated with the library's film collection.  In 2014, these materials were reincorporated into National Organization for Women: New York City Chapter Records (TAM 106). 
In 2014, the archived website was added as series XV. NOW's New York chapter's website was archived to the Internet Archive using the Archive-It service. Also in 2014, approximately 0.25 linear feet of materials discovered in the repository were added to the collection, mostly to Series VI. </p><p> In 2015, 2 boxes of photographs and negatives found in repository were incorporated into Series VIII: Photographs and Negatives. Artifacts and graphics found in repository in 2015 were added to Series IX: Artifacts, Ephemera, Graphics and Other Material. </p><p> Executive board meetings from a 2016 donation were incorporated into Series I: Administration, while legal briefs from the same donation were added as a new series, Series XIII: Legal Cases. </p><p> In 2018, 5 boxes of banners, videos, photos, and memorabilia were added to Series XIV: Unprocessed Materials as 2018 Accretion. These materials were originally loose in several boxes and have been moved into archival housing. Loose photos and documents were moved into folders by the archivist and given titles based on general topics. Born-digital records included in this accretion have been inventoried but not forensically imaged. These materials have not been arranged by an archivist.  </p><p> New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. </p>
