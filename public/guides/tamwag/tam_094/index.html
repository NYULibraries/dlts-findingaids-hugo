  <div>
      <p> Herman and Conway Associates, a firm of labor relations consultants, was the successor to Robert Maisel Associates. Although the exact year of succession could not be ascertained, the change was made sometime during the late 1940's. In its work on behalf of employees and employer associations, the firm dealt with important issues in labor- and management relations during the post-World War II era. Material on issues such as Communist involvement in labor organizations, government versus private ownership, health-care providers, public utilities and related topics are to be found within this collection. Richard Conway, while figuring in some of the correspondence and memos, does not appear to have played a central role. As far as one can judge from the records extant, Harry C. Herman had primary responsibility for the administration of the firm. He served in the infantry during World War II and reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was decorated with the Purple Heart twice and received the Silver Star and the Croix des Services Militaires of France. Mr. Herman was also instrumental in founding the Naval War College in Washington. He died on February 23, 1984 in Boca Raton, Florida. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The collection is organized in one series of subject files, arranged alphabetically by title. The files contain correspondences, memoranda, Senate and House bills, reports, newsclippings, and examples of union literature. Clearly this small collection does not represent a full record of the firm's work; there are gaps in documentation, and some items appear to be missing. The collection reflects management responses to the growth in influence and membership of America's organized labor force from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. Many case-files are concerned with alleged Communist influence and infiltration in unions and labor-management conflicts. </p><p> Files on the National Farmers Union (NFU) contain documents and articles concerning possible links between this organization and the Communist Party. The report entitled "A Total Basis for Executive Judgment and Evaluation of Trade union Forces in the Food Industry" details the left-wing activity in unions associated with the food industry. One such group was the united Packinghouse Workers Union; its president, Ralph Holstein, is profiled. It was not possible to determine if this was written by a member of the Herman and Conway Associates team, but it seems that the firm was involved in management's attempt to bolster their relations with the more moderate unions of the industry. Also relevant to the issue of communism and unions are files on the United Electrical Workers (UE). These focus on the wrangling between the UE and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. At issue was the representation of the Radio Corporation of America workers in Lancaster, PA. Files of clippings, notes and reports on the recording industry's strike following the Second World War highlight activities of the American Federation of Musicians and its colorful president James Petrillo. </p><p> Schenley Distillers is the only subject in this collection for which extensive correspondence has survived. An exchange of letters between Mr. Herman and Mr. Phil Shays, Schenley's Director of Personnel and Labor, is included. Also included is correspondence between Mr. Herman and Louis Rosenstil, Chairman of Schenley Industries. The working relationship between the firm and Schenley Distillers lasted about five years (1945-50). During that time Herman and Conway Associates carried out their investigation into the problems which existed between the distillery and unions at various Schenley plants. Reports are based upon recorded observations and personal interviews. Charles Scofield, a member of the Herman and Conway investigatory team, figures prominently in reports and correspondence. Extensive correspondence included exchanges between Herman and Phil Shays, Schenley?s Director of Personnel, and Louis Rosenstil, Chairman of Schenley Industries. </p><p> Files on Bonneville, Hells Canyon, Missouri Valley, Niagara, St. Lawrence, and the Tennessee Valley Authority deal with the issue of government versus private ownership of electrical power. Herman and Conway Associates appeared to have been actively engaged with the subject, but it was not entirely clear who engaged them or for what specific purpose. </p>
