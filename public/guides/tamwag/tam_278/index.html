    <p>Ira Gollobin (1911-2008) was a civil rights attorney who focused on immigration law. Gollobin worked for the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born from 1936-1982 and served as general counsel for the organization. During the 1980s, Gollobin served on the the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. He was involved in other left-wing causes, including defending individuals under investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee.

The collection contains case files representing Gollobin's work on both immigration and HUAC issues from the 1940s-1990. A significant portion of the collection represents research and advocacy regarding legal issues surrounding immigrant rights and labor. These materials including clippings, correspondence, pamphlets, posters, press releases, pleadings, and reports from nonprofits and government agencies. Prominent themes include labor issues for undocumented workers from Latin America, Haitian refugees, the dragnet raids on undocumented workers in the 1970s, the Rodino immigration bills of the 1970s, and positions of unions and other stakeholders in the ensuing legislative debate. A significant portion of the collection's documents were generated by the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The collection came to the repository in 2008 and was reboxed at this time. In 2013, minimal processing was undertaken to address preservation issues and provide box level access. Underfilled boxes were consolidated and acidic or dirty folders were replaced with archival folders. This amounted to about two thirds of total folders. Original titles were transcribed. Extensive duplicates and direct mailing advertisements were deaccessioned. </p><p> No archivist-devised arrangement was applied. Description was added at the box level to give researchers a sense of predominant themes and material types, and a finding aid with collection-level notes was written. </p>
