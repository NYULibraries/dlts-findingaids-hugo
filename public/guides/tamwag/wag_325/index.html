    <p>Rockwell "Rocky" Chin has been active in labor, community, and civil rights struggles in New York City since the early 1980s, particularly through his involvement with various Asian Pacific American (APA) organizations.

Spanning between 1966 to 2016, with the bulk of materials from 1984-2001, this collection documents Chin's work as an activist, his involvement in political campaigns, and his teaching. Materials include correspondence, memoranda, meeting minutes, newsletters, publications and reports, legal briefs, brochures, event and conference programs, speech and article drafts, flyers, press releases, and newspaper clippings. A large portion of the collection pertains to Chin's service on the New York City Commission on Human Rights and materials related to Asian American movement groups like Basement Workshop, APA labor unions, the Asian American studies movement, demonstrations and rallies organized around redistricting issues, and Asian American involvement in various local and national political campaigns. There are also collected publications, reports, and audiovisual recordings related to Asian American cultural events and labor and community activism.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> During processing in 2020, original folders were retained whenever possible. Where appropriate, materials were rehoused in archival folders. If original folder titles are available, they were transcribed onto the new folder with descriptive enhancements by the archivist as necessary. If the original folder was kept, loose labels were stapled to ensure accurate titling and prevent loss of information. Loose paper materials were placed in archival folders with descriptive titles by the archivist. In February 2020, mold-damaged and out-of-scope materials were deaccessioned. Two optical disks were identified and inventoried, and forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. </p><p> New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. </p>
