    <p>Frances Patai was an educator, writer, historian and feminist activist. Born in New York in 1930 she earned her bachelors and masters degrees at the City College of New York in the 1950s and taught English and communication courses throughout the City University of New York (CUNY) system. Throughout her career Patai was concerned with the rights and status of women, and in the last decade of her life she devoted her efforts to researching and writing a book on women medical personnel who volunteered during the Spanish Civil War. Patai died in 1998 before she could bring her project to fruition. She was 67 years old. The Patai Papers consist predominantly of research materials she gathered and drafts she produced during the course of her work on her unpublished book, <span class="ead-title">Heroines of the Good Fight: U.S. Women Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War</span>including articles, clippings, and notes.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Frances Patai was born in New York City's Lower East Side in 1930. As a teenager, Patai performed in Jewish resorts in the Catskills as an actress and dancer. In her twenties she attended classes at City College of New York earning her bachelor's degree in 1955 and her MA in 1957. Beginning in the 1970s she served as an English and communications instructor at various institutions in the City University of New York (CUNY) system including long-term appointments at John Jay and the Borough of Manhattan Community Colleges. </p><p> Throughout her career Patai was concerned with the rights and status of women, addressing in a series of essays and articles issues related to rape, pornography, and abuse. During the 1980s she worked with the feminist organization Woman Against Pornography, serving as spokesperson and organizing their annual WAP Awards, an event that promoted the non-sexist representation of women in advertising. In later life Patai turned her attention to the anti-fascist movements of the 1930s, and began to investigate the history of American volunteers who joined the Republican forces to fight against Franco's army during the Spanish Civil War. Patai focused her attention on the participation of American women volunteers in the Spanish Civil War devoting her efforts to researching and writing a book on the contributions of nurses. Through her friendship with Fredericka Martin - a nurse with the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy who accrued extensive biographical material on her former colleagues - Patai gained access to unique primary materials. Patai died in 1998 before she could bring her project to fruition. She was 67 years old. Shortly before her death, Patai established an endowment to the City College Center for Worker Education to fund annual courses and lectures on the Nazi Holocaust. </p><p> Sources: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">Rimmel, Leslie, "Frances (Francesca) Patai, 1930-1998," <span class="ead-title">Off Our Backs</span>(Washington), April 1998.</span><span class="ead-item">Leberstein, Stephen, "Eloquence of Former Chancellor Sparks Major CCNY Bequest," <span class="ead-title">CUNY Matters</span>, Spring 1998.</span></span>  </p>
