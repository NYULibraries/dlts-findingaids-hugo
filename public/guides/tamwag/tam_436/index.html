      <p> Materials found in collection; provenance is unknown. The accession numbers associated with this collection are 2008.026 and NPA.2008.036. </p><p> Websites were initially selected by curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in 2009 as part of the Feminism and Women's Movements Web Archive. In 2012, crawling was stopped for http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/ and https://www.peacewomen.org/.  In 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2018, ttp://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/ and https://www.peacewomen.org/ were re-added. The accession number associated with this accretion is 2019.089. </p>
