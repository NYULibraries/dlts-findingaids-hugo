    <p>William Fielding (1886-1974) was an author, editor, and sexologist. He left school before completing the eighth grade and worked at various manual labor jobs. In 1906, he enrolled in bookkeeping and accounting courses, and in 1909 was hired as secretary for the Tiffany Company, from which he retired in 1963. Fielding served as a trustee for the Tiffany Foundation from 1946. By 1913, Fielding had articles published in the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Call</span>, a newspaper of the Socialist Party, and began taking classes at the Rand School of Social Science, also a socialist institution. He became interested in social problems and birth control and wrote a number of books and pamphlets on sexology and psychology. The collection contains correspondence, typescripts of Fielding's autobiography, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">All the Lives I Have Lived</span> (Dorrance & Co., 1972), essays, reviews, poetry, and case histories. The case histories consist of correspondence with readers of Fielding's work in sexology and psychology who wrote to him for advice on personal matters, e.g., masturbation, homosexuality, transvestism, lesbians, birth control, impotence, frigidity, fetishes, nervous disorders and phobias. The correspondence series concerns Fielding's work at Tiffany's; his personal life and reflections; and his interest in and work relating to sexology, psychology, free thought, and other social issues.</p></div>

      <p> William J. (William John) Fielding (1886-1974) was an author, editor, and sexologist. Born in New Jersey, he left school before completing the eighth grade and first worked in blast furnaces and then as a sandhog, boring tunnels under the Hudson River. In 1906, he decided to prepare for a clerical career rather than continuing hard manual labor. That same year, he enrolled in bookkeeping and accounting courses, and in 1909 was hired as secretary for the Tiffany Company. By 1913, Fielding had articles published in the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Call</span> and began taking classes at the Rand School of Social Science. He became interested in social problems and birth control and wrote a number of books and pamphlets on sexology and psychology, thirty of which were published over the years in the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Little Blue Books</span> series, including a thirteen-volume series, "Rational Sex" (Emanuel Haldeman-Julius, publisher). Fielding also published articles in <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The New York Call</span>, the daily newspaper of the Socialist Party.  He served as editor and literary editor of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Newark Leader</span> (1915-22), as editor of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Know Thyself</span> (1913-24), and was active in Socialist Party politics in New Jersey throughout the 1920s. He also corresponded with Alfred Korzybski regarding the latter's theories of general semantics and mathematical reasoning.

  <div>
      <p> The papers contain correspondence; typescripts of Fielding's autobiography, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">All the Lives I Have Lived</span>; essays, reviews, and poetry; and case histories from Fielding's work as a sexologist.
