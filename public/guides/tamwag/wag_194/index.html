    <p>Philip M. Weightman, a native of Vicksburg, MS, began his career as a labor organizer and political activist as a teenager in St. Louis. In 1930 he moved to Chicago, where he became an organizer and representative of packinghouse workers. In 1948 he went to work for the CIO's Political Action Committee, based in Washington. The collection documents in detail Weightman's work as national field representative for the CIO Political Action Committee and as a staff member and Assistant Director of AFL-CIO COPE, until 1967. Correspondence, reports, publicity materials and clipping files document his work in labor and civil rights, with particular emphasis on labor's role in campaigns for voter registration among African-Americans. <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">NOTE: This collection is stored offsite, and advance notice is required for use.</span></p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Philip M. Weightman was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in Jone 13, 1902. His father was Philip Mitchell Weightman, a contractor and butcher; his mother was Sarah Watts of Port Gibson, MS. In Vicksburg he attended St. Mary's Catholic School, the Cherry Street Public School, and Mrs. Johnson's School (during the summer months). Later he attended Sumner High School, at night, in St. Louis, MO. </p><p> In the fall of 1917, at the age of fifteen, Weightman joined the Amalgamated Butcher Workmen in St. Louis. He and his family had moved there from Vicksburg via Memphis in 1916. A year later, at sixteen, he cut his teeth in politics by organizing a get-out-the-vote drive in the old Fifth Ward, when his father, a precinct captain was taken ill. In the following years Weightman rose through the ranks in the packing houses of St. Louis and Chicago to respected stature in the labor movement. </p><p> At a St. Louis Labor Day Parade organized by the Butcher Workmen in 1918, Weightman experienced his first unpleasant act of discrimination. After the parade the union has a celebration and served food. He was standing in line when someone told him had to "get on the other line." This union attitude hurt him deeply; he left the event vowing that he would never join another union. </p><p> Following his marriage to Eulalia Mays in 1920, he worked for several packing companies, and, after an involvement with the Al Smith presidential campaign, moved to Chicago in 1930. In 1937 he helped to organize Local 28 of the Packinghouse Workers, CIO, and became Chief Steward in his plant. In 1943 he became First International Vice-President of the United Packinghouse Workers, a post that he held until 1948 when he joined the staff of the CIO's Political Action Committee (PAC). CIO President Philip Murray selected Weightman for a special assignment in Panama to reorganize the administrative structure of the Government Employees Union there. He served as a Field Director for CIO-PAC from 1948 to 1955, and when the AFL and the CIO merged in 1955, he became a Field Director of the newly formed Committee on Political Education (COPE). In 1960 COPE Director James L. McDevitt named him Assistant National Director of COPE. </p><p> Weightman was also involved in community and civil rights activities. He was a member of the Chicago Human Rights Committee, First Vice-President of the Chicago NAACP, and a founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; and he often served as a consultant for the National Urban League and other groups. He worked tirelessly to increase black voter registration in the North and South, and formed alliances with other minority groups, in particular Puerto-Rican Americans and other Latino communities. His efforts on behalf of voter registration contributed to some crucial electoral victories. He played an active role in the Congressional elections of 1954, convincing his colleagues to emphasize economic as well as civil rights issues. </p><p> Among his notable achievements were the defeat of right-to-work proposals in California and Ohio, a record turnout of black voters for Senator Kefauver in Tennessee in 1959; helping build the overwhelming minority vote for John F. Kennedy in 1960; and upset New Jersey election of Richard Hughes for governor in 1961. </p><p> Upon his mandatory retirement in 1967 he was hired by the Office of Economic Opportunity as a Supervisory Labor Relations Specialist. He served as principal contact for those with questions concerning interpretation and application of labor-management agreements, unfair labor practices complaints, third party involvement in the agency labor relations program, and other related matters. Weightman retired completely from government employment in 1980. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The collection documents in detail Weightman's work as national field representative for the CIO Political Action Committee and as a staff member and Assistant Director of AFL-CIO COPE. There is no information on his early career and political activities or on his later move, after mandatory retirement from the AFL-CIO, to the Office of Economic Opportunity. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I: CIO-Political Action Committee, 1947-1958</span>, consists of two sections, work files arranged alphabetically by state and subject files arranged alphabetically by personal name or topic. Included are reports, memos, publicity material, correspondence and newsletters. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II: AFL-CIO-Committee on Political Education, 1949-1962</span>, begins with a series of files arranged alphabetically by state. Documenting the political work of AFL-CIO COPE, mostly for the period 1957-1962. The state files are followed by several groups of subject files, arranged alphabetically. Notable are the correspondence and reports of COPE Director Alexander (Al) Barkan and field workers Fannie Neal and Earl Davis (the latter reported to Weightman). Contents include incoming and outgoing correspondence, reports, publicity material, lists of volunteers, and background files on various political organizations. The last group of files documents political activity of AFL-CIO COPE at the national and international levels, including relations with the Democratic Party and interest in Mexican political developments. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series III: General Correspondence, 1951-1967</span>, is comprised of incoming and outgoing correspondence, arranged alphabetically by correspondent. These files give a detailed picture of Weightman's work as AFL-CIO COPE Assistant Director; notable are the extensive reports by Earl Davis on voter registration efforts in the South. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series IV: Voter Registration, 1951-1967</span>. This series thoroughly documents an issue that was a very high priority for AFL-CIO COPE in mid-century. Voter registration campaigns are tracked state by state and community by community, with background files on finances, cooperation with the NAACP and other organizations, statistical studies, training programs and conferences, and analyses of voting laws. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series V: Working Files, 1956-1962</span>, consists of subject files covering all aspects of Weightman's work, arranged alphabetically. The files are especially rich in material documenting the changing history and status of African-Americans in the period. There are files on racial integration in industry, education,, the armed forces and government; the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King, Jr.; African-American organizations and media; and voting patterns. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series VI, Newspaper Clippings and Press Releases, 1955-1967</span>, covers many of the same topics found in the subject files of Series V, but with an additional special emphasis on Africa and African political leaders. The clippings are mostly from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and local newspapers in the South. Press releases are mostly from U.S. labor and political organizations. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">NOTE: This collection is stored offsite, and advance notice is required for use.</span> </p>
