  <div>
      <p> Alger Hiss (1904-1996) was a State Department official who served in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and was involved in the establishment of the United Nations. In 1948 Hiss was named as a communist by Whittaker Chambers in a hearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Hiss was called before HUAC to testify and later filed a defamation lawsuit against Chambers. During the trial Chambers produced evidence that Hiss and his wife Priscilla had been involved in espionage, and had transmitted government documents to Chambers in 1938. In December 1948, Hiss testified before a grand jury in the Southern District of New York that neither he nor his wife had given government documents to Chambers and that he had not spoken to Chambers since 1937. Following his statements, the grand jury indicted Hiss on charges of perjury in <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">United States vs. Alger Hiss</span>. Alger Hiss was represented by the New York City-based law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. His first perjury trial began in May 1949 and ended in a mistrial. The second trial began in November 1949 and ended in a conviction. Hiss served three years in federal prison. After his release in 1953, Hiss maintained his innocence and continually fought to overturn his conviction. In 1975 Hiss, with William Ruben, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit to gain access to FBI documents related to the trials. Documents they obtained through the FOIA lawsuit formed the basis of a petition for a writ of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">coram nobis</span> that Hiss and his attorneys at Debevoise & Plimpton filed in 1978. The petition sought to overturn Hiss's conviction claiming that the FBI documents withheld evidence from the defense, but it was rejected in 1982. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The Debevoise & Plimpton Records on Alger Hiss (dated 1938-1980) contain materials from the Debevoise & Plimpton legal firm's representation of Alger Hiss in his 1949 perjury trials and his 1978 petition for a writ of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">coram nobis</span>. Records related to Hiss's 1949 trials include documents such as memoranda, motions, briefs, and testimony, which are accompanied by attorney notes and analysis. They also include attorney correspondence (dated 1948-1979), character witness interviews, copies of government documents, and newspaper clippings. Documents related to his 1979 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">coram nobis</span> petition comprise drafts of the petition, notes and files of attorney Robert von Mehren, scholarly articles, and research files. The collection documents not only Hiss's trials and the strategies employed in his defense, but also anti-communist sentiment and anxiety about political dissent during the Cold War. </p>

Materials in this collection were originally housed in large legal accordion files identifying case number, topic, and/or document type. Materials have been removed from files but have been maintained in the groupings established by the creators.  Many of the original folder titles have been retained, while others have been updated by the archivist for uniformity. Duplicate copies of bound trial transcripts were removed from the collection. </p>
