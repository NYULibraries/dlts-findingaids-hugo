      <p> Abraham Lincoln Brigade veteran Milton White was born as Morris White in Cleveland in 1917 to Ephim "Hyman" White (born 1894 in Russia) and Tanya White (also known as Tania Martini).  Within a few years, White was living in Brooklyn, where his parents were active in the Communist Party. </p><p> In 1937, White volunteered for service in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War.  He left for Spain on the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Paris</span> on March 27, 1937.  While serving as a private, sometimes using the name Morris White, he was wounded several times.  While in Spain, he wrote fictional stories, poems, plays, and songs about the war. </p><p> White returned home from Spain with a large contingent of veterans on the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Ausonia</span> on Dec 20, 1938.  He joined the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) and was actively involved in VALB events for the next couple of years.  A practiced musician, he often entertained attendees with his Spanish guitar. </p><p> During the Second World War, White served in the U. S. Army as a private.  By the end of the war, he was serving in the Miami field office of the Military Intelligence Division. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The collection contains White's writings, incoming correspondence, and artifacts from the Spanish Civil War.  A scrapbook and several notebooks belonging to his parents are also included. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I: Spanish Civil War, 1937-1939</span> contains artifacts, International Brigade documents, correspondence, and writings relating to White's service.  The only outgoing correspondence is two brief notes to his parents.  However, the incoming correspondence includes letters from his parents and friends, including two written by Spanish correspondents.  White's fictional writings about the Spanish Civil War include stories, poems, plays, and songs (some of the latter in Spanish). </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II: General Files, 1920-1946</span> consists largely of notes and notebooks kept by White's parents, mostly in Russian.  There is also an identity certificate issued by the Russian Consul in New York to Ephim White in 1920.  Finally, there is a small amount of material on Milton White's activities after his return from Spain. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series III: Scrapbook</span> is made up of pages from a scrapbook kept by White's parents during the time he was in Spain.  Most of the material is in the form of newspaper clippings and flyers.  It covers the subject of the Spanish Civil War, especially as it relates to White, as well as general leftist activities during this period. </p>
