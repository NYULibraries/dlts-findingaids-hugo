  <div>
      <p> Steve Early was an organizer, strike strategist, labor educator, lawyer, and a national staff member of the Communications Workers of America (CWA). CWA-represented telephone workers in the Northeast participated in national, regional or statewide strikes in 1983, 1986, 1989, 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2011. During these struggles the CWA cooperated with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which also represented some telecommunications workers. As many as 60,000 workers in New York and New England were involved in the anti-concession strikes during this period at NYNEX and other major telecommunications employers. The four month NYNEX strike in 1989 defeated health care cost shifting. The CWA also struggled against employers' give-back demands, including the demand for forced overtime, and struggled to defended defined benefit pensions and retiree health coverage. The CWA also fought for card check unionization, and for employer neutrality during organizing campaigns, especially at Verizon Wireless, the company's fast-growing and almost entirely non-union cellular subsidiary. </p><p> As a CWA representative in this region and telecommunications industry strike coordinator, Early was involved in local contract negotiations, helping to publicize strike issues, organize mass rallies and marches, pressure company and public officials for favorable settlements, and generate grassroots community-labor support. Early is also the author of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Embedded With Organized Labor</span> (2009) and his articles, reviews, and op-ed pieces have appeared in labor, progressive and mainstream periodicals and newspapers. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection contains files collected, and in some instances created by Steve Early in his roles as a Communications Workers of America (CWA) official and as a writer on labor topics. The collection documents the struggles of the CWA in New York, New Jersey, and New England with the NYNEX telephone company and other major telecommunications employers, such as Verizon and the Southern New England Telephone Company, including contract negotiations and strikes. These materials are from New York and New England CWA locals and CWA District 1, from the 1980s until 2007. Among the materials are meeting agendas and notes, internal union memos, strike strategy memos and training materials, injunction-related legal papers, daily newsletters on strike proceedings, flyers, clippings, circulars and other printed ephemera, and several oversized posters. The collection also documents Early's work as an organizer for the CWA and success in campaigning and collaborating with other unions and social justice groups to achieve change in the union. </p>

  <div>
      <p> In 2012, the collection was rehoused in archival quality folders. Folder titles provided by Early when the materials were donated were maintained and loose materials were put into folders and titles were supplied. In 2013, the materials were arranged and alphabetized in series based upon Early's original box inventory. The title of the collection was changed from the Steve Early Communications Workers of America Research Files to the current title. </p>
