    <p>Bruce D. Boling is a linguist, historian, and librarian whose research focused on the Irish language with specific emphasis on the English dialects spoken in Ulster. He also collaborated with historian Kerby A. Miller on several projects related to Irish immigration history, including <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Irish Immigrants in the Land of Canaan: Letters and Memoirs from Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1675-1815</span>. This collection documents Bruce Boling's research on the Irish language. Materials include maps, memoranda, correspondence, transcriptions and annotations of research material, journal articles on various aspects of linguistics, and original writing concerning aspects of English and Irish language dialects in Ulster. The collection provides resource materials not only on the history of Irish immigration and the changing nature of regional linguistic patterns, but also the way in which social scientists interrogate the intersection between linguistics and social history. The collection also documents developments in the field of Irish American historiography, including Boling's interdisciplinary focus and methodology.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Bruce D. Boling is a linguist, historian, and librarian whose research focused on the Irish language with specific emphasis on the English dialects spoken in Ulster.  Boling received a Bachelor's and Master's degree from the University of Iowa, a Master's in Library Science from the University of California at Berkeley, and a Masters and PhD in linguistics with a specialty in Celtic languages from Harvard University.  He taught courses in linguistics at Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and held research fellowships at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.  Boling also worked as a language consultant and a librarian at Brown University, the University of Wyoming, the Library of Congress, and the University of New Mexico. </p><p> Using immigrants' letters and other sources, Boling sought to reconstruct the Ulster region's 18th- and 19th-century dialects.  He also collaborated with historian Kerby Miller on several projects related to Irish immigration history, including <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Irish Immigrants in the Land of Canaan: Letters and Memoirs from Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1675-1815</span>. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection documents Bruce Boling's research on the Irish language. Materials include maps, memoranda, correspondence, transcriptions and annotations of research material, journal articles on various aspects of linguistics, and original writing concerning aspects of English and Irish language dialects in Ulster. The majority of the collection consists of materials produced in the process of researching and contributing to <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Irish Immigrants in the Land of Canaan: Letters and Memoirs from Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1675-1815</span>, including copies, transcriptions, and translations of 18th- and 19th-century Irish immigrants' letters to family members. The collection provides resource materials not only on the history of Irish immigration and the changing nature of regional linguistic patterns, but also the way in which social scientists interrogate the intersection between linguistics and social history. The collection also documents developments in the field of Irish American historiography, including Boling's interdisciplinary focus and methodology. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Upon receipt, the collection contained several distinct types of materials, but no consistent overall arrangement. Portions of Boling's work concerning original immigrant letters were often grouped together in a loose alphabetical arrangement in folders with accurate labels. Other like materials, however, were loose or in unlabeled folders. The majority of the copies of secondary journal articles (which comprise Series III) were well-labeled, but not in any discernible order. Some were also loose and unfoldered. Loose articles were foldered and labeled, in the same format as those that were foldered. Pieces of Boling's original writings, including essays, manuscript drafts, and conference presentations were scattered throughout the boxes. Due to their distinct nature, they were physically and intellectually brought together, arranged alphabetically, and described. </p><p> 
Original folder titles were used, with descriptive clarifications as necessary. When no original folder title existed, one was created by the archivist in the same form as Boling's scheme. Not all descriptive folder titles, however, were accurate; some folders appear to have been reused and retain the original titles.  In these cases, new descriptive folder titles were applied. In addition to this descriptive work, the collection was also rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes. </p>
