  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) was founded in 1973 as the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and led by Michael Harrington (1928-1989), best known as the author of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Other America</span> (1962) and became the DSA upon its merger with the New American Movement (a New Left youth organization) in 1982. Harrington and others who left the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Foundation over its support of the Vietnam War were among the principal founders of DSOC. DSA established chapters in virtually every state, including chapters at many colleges and universities, worked to build a progressive presence in the Democratic Party through its Democratic Agenda project, worked closely with progressive labor unions and leaders, feminists and others to promote a social democratic agenda and a peaceful foreign policy, and advocated for socialism while strongly criticising Communism. DSA also published <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Democratic Left</span>, founded the Socialist Scholars Conference (now known as the Left Forum), and established the Insitute for Democratic Socialism. DSA also has a youth and student section, Young Democratic Socialists of America, which organizes on university, college, and high school campuses. DSA is the U.S. affiliate of the Socialist International. </p>

Additional websites were added to Series XIV in 2019-2020. </p><p> Materials in the 2019 accretion were rehoused in acid-free boxes. Loose VHS tapes were rehoused in cases. Posters were intellectually added to Series XII. Unprocessed. Born-digital materials were identified and physically inventoried, but not forensically imaged.
