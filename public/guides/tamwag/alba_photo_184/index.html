  <div>
      <p> Paul Burns ([1906?]-1996) was a writer, teacher, and Writers Union activist. Boston-born of Irish parentage, he worked his way through college and graduated from Middlebury College with an MA in Sociology. In 1937 he enlisted in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight against Franco's rebel forces in Spain. Burns was a sergeant in command of the Irish section and later became second in command of the infantry, Lincoln Battalion. He was active on the Jarama front and participated in two of the major campaigns of the war; the Battle of Madrid and the offensive at Brunete from July to August 1937. He was wounded twice—first, when shot in the arms and legs in Jarama on February 23, 1937 and again, in Brunete, when he was wounded by machine-gun fire. He left the International Brigades with a final rank of lieutenant. </p><p> Burns returned to the United States in October 1937 and was subsequently elected national commander of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He wrote for the <span class="ead-title">Daily Worker</span>, <span class="ead-title">Sunday</span>, and <span class="ead-title">Story Magazine</span>. After settling in Chicago, he became associate editor of the <span class="ead-title">Daily Record</span>, working in his spare time on a book of stories about the Irish battalion of the Lincoln Brigade. He was also a correspondent for the United Nations. Burns died in 1996. He was 90 years old. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Paul Burns Photograph Collection includes 76 black and white photographs of varying sizes: 62 5.5 x 4 inch prints, six 8 x 10 inch prints, five 5 x 7 inch prints, one 4.5 x 3.5 inch print, one 4 x 3 inch print, and one 3.25 x 2.25 inch print. There is also one black and white negative that matches print number 184:1:1:27. The negative is contained in folder 27. </p><p> The bulk of the Paul Burns Photograph Collection consists of photographs Burns gathered during the course of his work as a commander in the International Brigades. The collection contains group photographs and portraits of members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Spanish soldiers and scouts and other international volunteers including Cubans and Yugoslavs. </p><p> When the collection was donated to ALBA, Burns provided a numbered inventory with captions, which corresponded to 63 prints. These photographs can be found in Series I. The remaining 13 prints are arranged by subject. </p><p> Among the individuals pictured are Jack Bjoze, Harry Fisher, Oliver Law, Steve Nelson, Douglas Roach, Jack Shirai, and Vladimir Copi'c. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I:</span>The 63 prints in the series are arranged according to Burns' original numbering scheme. Burns provided typed captions, which are filed with the prints in each folder. Includes black and white photographs taken in Spain during the Civil War. In the captions, Burns' original writing and syntax have been preserved. In a few cases the spelling of names has been corrected. Approximately three-quarters are group shots of volunteers-primarily American-but also Cubans, Germans (Thaelmann Brigade), Greeks, Irish, Scots, Welsh, and Yugoslavs. Of particular interest are the photos pertaining to the Tom Mooney Machine Gun Company and the Saklatvala Battalion. Tom Mooney was a trade unionist who, in 1937, was serving a life sentence in Alcatraz. The Saklatvala Battalion was the first British unit, which included Welsh, Scots, and Irish volunteers. It was named after Shapurji Saklatvala, a native of India and one of the first members of the Communist Party to become a British MP. The remainder include prints of daily life (cooking, washing, etc.), wall newspapers (public bulletin boards for the troops), a front-line barbershop, a court-martial proceeding, a concert behind enemy lines, and a grave of a member of the Saklatvala Battalion. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II:</span>The 13 prints are arranged alphabetically by topic. Includes black and white group shots (identified and unidentified) taken in Spain during the Civil War, a portrait of Douglas Roach and John Perrone in Spain, a veterans' march in the United States [New York City?], and enlargements/copy prints. Burns most likely created the copy prints in this series. Some of these prints have Burns' original notations. </p>
