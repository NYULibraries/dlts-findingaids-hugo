    <p>This collection details the development of CWA Local 1150 (long-distance telephone workers employed by AT&T), and its history as a militant force in the New York-area communications industry. The local was divided into three sections: Traffic (operators), Plant (maintenance and technical) and Administrative (clerical, white collar); and the arrangement of the records often reflects these divisions. The collection includes correspondence, memos, reports, election records, bulletins, clippings, bargaining records and agreements, and photographs.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection presents an unusually full and detailed picture of the development of one of the major locals of the predominantly white-collar CWA. Local 1150 has been distinguished by its militant and imaginative stance in dealing with rapidly changing conditions in an industry dominated by a single powerful employer, the ATT System. </p><p> Long Lines telephone workers are those responsible for long-distance and overseas service; they operate and maintain the links between local telephone systems, and also handle various special services (e.g., radio and telegraph services to the press and other special clients) offered through the ATT system. From the beginning Long Lines services were largely based in New York City, and New York Long Lines workers formed the first, largest and most active union local in what was to become a separate department of ATT and a separate Bargaining Unit of the CWA. </p><p> Through the period covered by this collection half or more of all Long Lines workers were women. The New York Local was (and is) divided into three Sections representing a variety of job types and skill levels: Traffic (mostly operators), Plant (installation and maintenance), and Administrative (clerical and engineering). The first and third were largely female, while Plant was virtually all male. The relative sizes of the sections were roughly reflected in the composition of the Local's fifteen-person Executive Board: eight representatives from Traffic, three Plant, and four Administrative. All local officials, including unit stewards, were elected by the membership. </p><p> The post-World War I period saw the first stirrings of interest in union organization among telephone workers; these were headed off by the creation of a company union (the Telephone Workers Association) and by strict paternalistic oversight, especially of women workers. Despite a rigorous (and often unpaid) training period, high stress on the job, low pay, and little opportunity for advancement, telephone work was generally well regarded by women --at least as compared to other white-collar jobs open to them. The company counted on having a young female work-force with a high turnover rate and little solidarity or interest in union organizing. By 1941 ATT reported the average age for beginning operators as eighteen, and still routinely conducted interviews with applicants' parents before hiring. </p><p> A small group of militant and determined workers began efforts to organize in Long Lines in the mid-1930s. Passage of the Wagner Act in 1935 gave them the impetus to replace the company union with a genuinely independent local organization. They then faced the question of how to link up with other organized telephone workers. A series of national meetings and conventions in 1938-39 (reflecting deep division over local autonomy vs. a strong national union) resulted in the formation of the National Federation of Telephone Workers, a loosely-structured umbrella group. The New York Long Lines Local, by now 9,400 members strong and certified by the NLRB, was the third largest member of the Federation. </p><p> Impatience with progress at the national level led the New York Local to reorganize itself in 1940 as a component of a new body, the Federation of Long Lines Telephone Workers (FLLTW). The FLLTW became the focus of broader organizing efforts and negotiated its first contract with ATT in October 1940. The heroic (and essential) service of telephone workers during World War II, plus the constraints of wartime strike bans and wage freezes, left Long Lines workers eager for a more effective, militant program. In 1945 the FLLTW won a wage increase, setting the pace for other telephone workers. Seeking even greater bargaining strength, nine New York Long Lines locals then merged to form Local 1 of the FLLTW, which in turn revised its constitution and renamed itself the American Union of Telephone Workers (AUTW). </p><p> The period of the late 1940s was characterized by growing dissatisfaction with NFTW weakness and growing sentiment for the creation of a genuine national union and affiliation with the CIO. Opinion within the AUTW was still divided and for a while the CIO carried out its own organizing campaign among communications workers, through its Telephone Workers Organizing Committee (TWOC). In 1946 several telephone locals (including New York Long Lines) formed the Communications Workers of America, and they went on to lead a bitter two-month national strike in 1947. After a brief period of re-entry into the AUTW (now affiliated with the TWOC-CIO), Long Lines workers finally rejoined the CWA in 1949, as Local 1 of CWA Divison 10. In April 1951 New York Long Lines formally adopted its present title of Local 1150, CWA Division (now district) 1. </p><p> The years from 1949 through the 1970s saw a quickening pace of innovation and automation in the communications industry. The 1950s brought Electronic Switching Systems and wider use of co-axial cables, microwave communications, and data-processing machines. In the 60s Direct Distance Dialing and communications satellites were introduced, and the 70s brought laser and fiber optics technology. Although the ultimate effect of these changes was to be a drastically reduced Local membership, Local 1150 was able to win substantial gains during the first decades of its existence. Wages, working hours and seniority rights were improved, and the Local negotiated military service leaves and an overtime equalization plan that were models for the industry. Local 1150 also initiated a wartime Blood Bank program that resulted in the creation of a national Blood Bank for ATT employees. In 1952 a Local 1150 grievance resulted in the creation of a new title, Assistant Engineer, the highest-paid title in the Bargaining Unit. </p><p> The Local has participated in a number of strikes and has loyally supported the struggles of fellow workers. Members' refusal to cross Western Electric workers' picket lines in 1950 resulted in a lock-out, and the Local raised $56,000 to support a Southern Bell strike in 1956. Major national CWA strikes in 1971 and 1974 resulted in an agency shop agreement and a national contract. </p><p> Both automation and restructuring have posed persistent threats to the vitality of Local 1150. Beginning in the 1950s ATT began shifting some of its Long Lines operations away from the New York area. Between 1971 and 1977 both Long Lines headquarters and most of the Administrative workers were relocated to Bedminster, New Jersey. In 1983 the huge International Operating Center in Manhattan was closed, resulting in a major lay-off of traffic workers. Other important changes in company structure and working conditions were a direct result of the court order for ATT divestiture, which took effect January 1, 1984. In 1986 Local 1150's jurisdiction was split, with the creation of CWA Local 1058, representing New Jersey Administrative employees. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection reflects the complex history of organizing among Long Lines communications workers, from early efforts to shake off ATT paternalism and condescension through the heyday of Local 1150 as a vanguard local of the CWA. Although the strength of the collection is in the period 1949 through the late 1960s, the sparser selection of materials for the pre-CWA period is exceptionally valuable in helping to trace the fledgling New York local through rapid changes in name and structure. The series of Executive Board Minutes begins in 1939, shortly before the creation of the FLLTW. Files of minutes and correspondence and a few agreements dating from the early forties reflect the FLLTW's attempts, with minimal guidance from the National Federation of Telephone Workers, to respond to the exceptional war-time demands of both government and employers. The immediate post-war period, which saw the reconstitution of the local as Local 1 of the new AUTW, is well covered in the Correspondence, Elections, and Contracts series. </p><p> Throughout its history --even into the 1970s when automation had drastically reduced the number of operators and other female employees --the New York Long Lines local has been a working partnership between men and women, at all levels of union activity. Not only the role of women as officers but also the concerns of women members are amply illustrated in every part of the collection. Among the outstanding women leaders who are strongly represented in correspondence and other series are Norma F. Naughton, an activist from the early 1930s who held leadership posts in the FFLTW and became the first president of AUTW Local 1 in 1945; Elaine T. Gleason, another long-time activist who served briefly as Local President and left in the late 1950s to become National Director of the CWA's Long Lines Bargaining Unit; Patricia Meckle, who was active in the Traffic Section in the 1950s and went on to serve for many years as Education Chair and then Local Secretary-Treasurer; Clara L. Allen, another Local Secretary-Treasurer, who went on to become New Jersey Area Director, and Angela M. Carroll, Legislative Chair and Secretary-Treasurer in the 1960s. </p><p> Male officers whose activity is well documented in the collection include John H. Lotz, Local President 1949-53; George T. Myerscough, Local President 1961-63 and Long Lines Director until 1974, Joseph F. McNiff, former Plant Division Chair who became President in the early 1970s; Morton Bahr, CWA District I Director in the 1970s (from 1985 International President); and Joseph A. Beirne and W. A. Smallwood, who served as CWA International President and Secretary-Treasurer respectively from the early days through most of the period covered by this collection. </p><p> While wages and working conditions in general were always central concerns in dealings with management, the pressures of rapid technological and structural change in the industry are also reflected in the Local's energetic struggles over matters of job classification, promotion and reassignment. Conflicts over these issues are particularly prominent in the Elections, Contracts, and Clippings series. The Election records document occasional efforts by groups dissatisfied with the handling of these issues to oppose and unseat the official leadership. They also reflect the discontent, in the 1970s, of the growing body of New Jersey-based Long Lines workers with New York union leadership; the eventual outcome was the formation of a separate NJ Long Lines Local. </p><p> Despite gaps in some series, the collection offers excellent opportunities to study important events and issues from a variety of perspectives. For example, the attitude of the local toward participation in the national telephone strike of 1947 can be followed through the Executive Board and committee minutes, through the correspondence of local officers, in election and referendum materials, in the Local's newsletter, and in the very full selection of newspaper clippings for that event. A later cause celebre was the so-called "Hidden Camera Case" of 1963, in which the Local lodged a firm (and successful) protest against management's placing of a camera in a men's washroom after alleged incidents of vandalism there (documented in photographs in the collection's photographs series); local members' and officials' responses to this violation of privacy, and the company's replies, can be traced in the minutes of meetings with management, in members' correspondence, in clippings, and in election publicity materials. </p><p> Although the bulk and main emphasis of the collection are to be found in the long series devoted to internal, official workings of the Local and to negotiations with management, there are also some smaller groups of documents which are of exceptional interest. For example, portions of the Minutes and Correspondence series covering the periods of World War II and the Korean War reflect the Local's strenuous efforts to serve members, both on active service and as veterans. The fragmentary records of the Welfare and Social Committees, as well as the file of correspondence with the NYC Central Labor Council, illustrate Local 1150's pioneering programs to promote the health and morale of members and their families. The correspondence file devoted to the Local's political and legislative concerns contains replies from such New York political luminaries as Emmanuel Celler and Adam Clayton Powell and from several U.S. presidents and Secretaries of Labor. The surviving records of Arbitration findings are few, but they reflect a wide variety of issues, from the defense of seniority rights and benefits to women's struggles for equal opportunities in promotion. There are also 45 additional boxes of unprocessed materials that consist of general files and grievances. </p>
