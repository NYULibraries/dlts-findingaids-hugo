  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> In 1975, a group of civil rights, community, labor, and student activists came together to found the New York Marxist School, which became part of the larger Brecht Forum, a left political, cultural and educational center in New York City. A leading role was played by Arthur Felberbaum (1935-1979), earlier a Trotskyist activist. The NYMS sought to promote the study and renewal of Marxist ideas and their application to contemporary issues. In 1984, New York Marxist School became incorporated as the Brecht Forum to include a broader range of educational and artistic programs. The New York Marxist School remained the Forum's core project, but also expanded to include additional projects like the Institute for Popular Education, founded in 1990 in collaboration with the Theater of the Oppressed Laboratory & Arts at the Brecht. The Brecht Forum offered programs designed to promote critical analysis of capitalist society through programs such as public lectures and seminars, art exhibitions, performances, popular education workshops, and language classes. Brecht Forum closed in 2014 due to financial difficulties. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection contains the records of the New York Marxist School (NYMS) and Brecht Forum, a Marxist educational institution based in Brooklyn, New York. Originally established as two organizations, NYMS and Brecht Forum merged in 1985. The collection includes the institutional records of both organizations before and after their incorporation. Brecht Forum records include financial, fundraising and donor materials; Brecht Forum newspapers; flyers for events hosted by Brecht Forum; correspondence; photographs; files related to programming and educational courses; minutes and reports from the New York Marxist School and Marxist Education Collective; audio cassette recordings of conference events and lectures, and four hard drives. New York Marxist School records include early organizational files, meeting minutes, educational and programming files, conference materials, and promotional materials. NYMS remained an educational center after it was incorporated in Brecht Forum, and consequently records from each organization overlap to some degree. </p>

      <p> Records in this collection are described in groupings by format and subject; the order in which files came to Tamiment has been maintained within those groupings. Materials in this collection have not been arranged by an archivist. Loose materials were housed in archival folders and titled by the archivist. </p><p> In 2014, the archived website was added as a series. Accession 2013.127 was added to this collection in 2014 as boxes 36-38. </p><p> The Brecht Forum Records and New York Marxist School Records were originally established as two separated collections. In 2015, the New York Marxist School Records (TAM 149) were repatriated into the Brecht Forum Records (TAM 635) and added as Series II: Mary Boger New York Marxist School Records. At this time the collection title was changed to the Brecht Forum and New York Marxist School Records (TAM 635). </p><p> In 2017 materials in this collection were rehoused. Files in Series I: Brecht Forum Records were removed from hanging files, under-filled boxes were condensed, and box numbers were updated to reflect changes in extent. Groupings established in hanging files have been retained. Materials in Series II: Mary Boger New York Marxist School Records that were loose in boxes were placed in archival housing. The box list was updated at this time to provide more detailed description of materials contained in this series. </p>
