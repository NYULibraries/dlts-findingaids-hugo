    <p>The Pauline Park Papers contains material from 1986-2015 documenting the advocacy, activism, and writing of Pauline Park, a transgender activist, speaker, writer, and educator. A large portion of the collection contains material from the New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy (NYAGRA) and Queens Pride House (QPH) two organizations that Park helped co-found, in 1998 and 1997, respectively,  and lead. Park campaigned for the transgender rights law enacted by the New York City Council in 2002, and in 2005 became the first openly transgender grand marshal of the New York City Pride March. Park has been the keynote speaker at many LGBT and Asian American conferences and events held in the United States. She has written extensively about arts and culture, music, spirituality, politics, theatre, race, and LGBT health and rights. Her writing has been published in journals, newspapers, and newsletters. This collection contains materials on subjects such as transgender health, identity, community, and public policy, and includes correspondence, board meeting minutes, photographs, VHS tapes, conference name badges, certificates, audio recordings, original poetry and creative writing, notes, speeches, flyers and programs for events and conferences related to QPH and NYAGRA, press featuring Park, and letters to politicians and allied organizations advocating the passage of LGTBQ inclusion and non-discrimination legislation.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection contains materials related to the advocacy, activism, and writing of Pauline Park from 1986 to 2015. The bulk of the material in this collection comes from the early 1990s to the mid 2010s, and documents Park's work as co-founder and co-leader of the New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy, the first New York statewide transgender advocacy organization, and Queens Pride House, the LGBT community center of Queens, New York. The collection contains some of Park's published and unpublished writing which addresses topics of transgender health, identity, community, and public policy as well as race, national identity, philosophy, spirituality, and the arts. Materials in the collection include correspondence, programs, digital images, photographs, VHS and audio cassette tapes, conference name badges, certificates, audio recordings, original poetry and creative writing, flyers for events and conferences related to Queens Pride House (QPH) and the New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy (NYAGRA) and other organizations.

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information Note </h3>
  <div>
      <p> At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused into new acid-free folders and boxes, with original folder titles transcribed. The original order of the collection as maintained by Pauline Park has been retained, with the exception of audiovisual and oversize items which were removed and rehoused in appropriate size boxes. Box-level descriptions were created by an archivist based on the contents of each box. </p><p> At the time of processing, all materials in six record cartons were rehoused into manuscript boxes due to overfilling and box tearing. Rehousing materials from the six record cartons caused the number of boxes to expand from 8 to 18. During processing folders were scored and marked with the collection call number, box number, and folder number; most of the original folder titles were retained, although there were some descriptive enhancements. A number of newspaper clippings intermixed within all of the series which were photocopied onto preservation paper for conservation purposes. </p><p> Born-digital material was imaged and labeled. One optical disc was processed using Forensic Toolkit, and an audio disc was imaged and uploaded to permanent storage. One floppy disc was imaged and the file was uploaded to permanent storage. </p><p> New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. </p>
