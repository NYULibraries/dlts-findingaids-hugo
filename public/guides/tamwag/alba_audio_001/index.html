    <p>U.S. men and woman who had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War joined together as the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) in December 1937 upon their return from Spain. In the 1970s the organization began to collect historical materials from its members, with a view to creating an archive documenting its history.  This general audiotape collection is made up of tapes gathered by VALB over many years. Some items were donated by veterans and their families or by individuals who created them in the course of various projects (conferences, rallies, radio programs, etc.). The collection includes many interviews with individual veterans, tapes of public events, and a series of music tapes.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> U.S. men and women who had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War joined together as the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) in December 1937 as they began to return from Spain. </p><p> The organization adopted a constitution and a formal structure in 1939. VALB originally raised money for the embattled Spanish Republic, assisted wounded veterans, helped veterans resettle and find jobs, and tried to awaken the U.S. public to the significance of the Spanish Civil War and the Loyalist cause. In later years, VALB campaigned strenuously against the Franco regime in Spain, assisted refugees and addressed other political issues, including U.S. policy in Cuba, Nicaragua and Vietnam. In addition to their headquarters in New York City, VALB had "posts" Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, and more informal groups in other cities and regions. </p><p> In the 1970s the organization began to collect historical materials from its members, with a view to creating an archive documenting its history.  That archive, originally housed at Brandeis University, is now part of the Tamiment Library at New York University.  </p><p> For additional information on the history of VALB see the guide to the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Records, ALBA #19. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The collection consists of 175 audio cassettes collected by or related to the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). The audio collection was formed from tapes gathered by VALB over many years. Some items were donated by veterans and their families or by individuals who created them in the course of various projects.  </p><p> The items cover a wide array of materials including: interviews with individual veterans, live (amateur) recordings of events in Spain, musical recordings (both personal and commercial), and recordings of VALB events such as the 50th anniversary celebrations in the Bay Area and NYC. The interviews' focus is usually on the veterans' memories of their time in Spain.  </p><p> The tapes are arranged in three series. <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I: Interviews, 1964-2002</span>; includes interviews with individuals and with small groups and talks presented, for example, in classes; it also includes publicly aired interviews from radio programs. <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II: Public Events, 1970-1999</span>; includes presentations by veterans on trips to Nicaragua and China, live recordings from the veterans' trip to Spain in 1986, and the 50th anniversary celebrations in the Bay area and NYC. <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series III: Music, 1976-2002</span>; includes both commercial releases and home recordings by veterans and others. Some of the recordings are tape copies of other recordings, primarily records. Notable is a well executed home recording by Max Parker, of his memories of being a prisoner of war in Spain, which combines narration with song -- possibly a preliminary recording for or an unedited version of material he eventually released on a commercial recording.  </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Arrangement</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The tapes are organized in 3 series:  I: Interviews, Speeches, Discussions, 1964-2002; II: Public events, 1970-1999; III: Music, 1976-2002. </p><p> Each recording has been assigned a unique item number (e.g. ALBA A 1-001), and the collection is arranged in item number order. For interview tapes (Series I) the item number order roughly follows the alphabetical order of the last name of the interviewee, with a few exceptions. Some tapes contain multiple interviewees and are ordered according to how the names were written on the cassette. Tapes in Series II and III are arranged alphabetically by title. </p>
