      <p> Dr. Mick Moloney (1944-) is a musician, folklorist, and Global Distinguished Professor of Music and Irish Studies at New York University.  He immigrated to the United States in 1973, earning a Ph.D. in folklore and folklife from the University of Pennsylvania.  He has recorded and produced over forty albums of traditional music, acted as advisor for scores of festivals and concerts, and served as artistic director for the musical ensemble The Green Fields of America.  In 1999, Moloney was awarded the National Heritage Award of the National Endowment of the Arts, the highest official honor of traditional artist can receive in the United States. </p><p> Moloney is the author of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Far from the Shamrock Shore</span> (2002) and numerous essays on Irish music and musical culture, and the co-editor of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Close to the Floor: Irish Dance from the Boreen to Broadway</span> (2009). </p><p> Sources:<br>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Mick Moloney Irish-American Music and Popular Culture Papers document Dr. Moloney's academic, professional, and performative interests and activities.  This subcollection consists of research, administrative, and personal files; scholarly literature on folklore and ethnicity; materials related to song and music collecting; concert posters, programs, and other memorabilia; and photographs.  The materials illustrate themes such as immigration and assimilation viewed through the lens of Irish-America's engagement with and expression of its own popular culture, with specific emphasis on its musical traditions.  The time period most heavily documented in this subcollection (1975-2000) witnessed both a reinvestment by Irish-America in its cultural traditions and a transition of its musical traditions from the home to the stage, accompanied by unprecedented national recognition.  The subcollection illustrates the shifts in policies regarding arts funding and programming; the valorization of ethnicity in the United States during the late 20th century; the rise in prominence of female performers of traditional music; and the Irish presence on and repertoire of the Philadelphia and New York music scenes. </p>

      <p> The original order of series I-IV was maintained except in the case of obvious misfiling.  Dr. Moloney employed numerous people to organize his papers prior to accession with unpredictable results.  Series VI: Photos had been made into a separate subcollection (AIA 031.006), but was later integrated into the Papers subcollection. </p><p> In 2014, the archived website was added as Series VII. An additional website was added to the finding aid in 2019. </p>

  <div>
      <p> New York University's Division of Libraries, in conjunction with Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, purchased the Mick Moloney Collection for the Archives of Irish America in 2006.  Until the Collection was transferred to New York University, under the supervision of Dr. Michael Nash, Head of the Tamiment Library, the materials were stored in Dr. Moloney's house in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The accession numbers associated with this collection are 2006.071 and 2010.019. </p><p> http://mickmoloney.com/index.html was initially selected by curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in 2014 as part of the Arts and Cultural Left Web Archive. n 2015, this website was migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2019, http://mickmoloney.com/ was added to the web archive to replace http://mickmoloney.com/index.html. The accession number associated with this website is 2019.130. </p>
