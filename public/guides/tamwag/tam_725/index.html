    <p>Billionaires for Bush was a grassroots media campaign that used culture jamming and street theater to satirize politicians supporting corporate interests and the upper class. Activists wore costumes to parody the wealthy and jokingly supported political campaigns, with the greatest amount of activity during the 2000 and 2004 U.S. presidential elections. Since 2005, the group continues to advocate on a number of economic issues, including income inequality, gentrification, taxation policies, and Social Security privatization. The Billionaires for Bush Records document the organization's activism, with majority of the materials in this collection document the group's street theater and other actions during the 2000 and 2004 United States presidential elections. Materials in this collection include photographs, correspondence between organizers, printed suggestions for participating, flyers for distribution at actions, drafts of public statements, promotional ephemera like brochures, notes from planning meetings, newspaper clippings, and costumes used in actions. In addition to documenting specific activism during the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, the collection reveals a larger context of activism against economic inequality, as well as the tactics used by the organization, such as culture jamming and street theater.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Billionaires for Bush was a grassroots media campaign that used culture jamming and street theater to satirize politicians supporting corporate interests and the upper class. The organization was first founded by Andrew Boyd as "Billionaires for Forbes" during the Republican Party nomination process of the 2000 U.S. presidential election. Activists wore costumes to parody the wealthy and jokingly supported conservative political campaigns benefiting corporate interests, with the greatest amount of activity during the 2000 and 2004 U.S. presidential elections. Since 2005, the group continues to advocate on a number of economic issues, including income inequality, gentrification, taxation policies, and Social Security privatization. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Billionaires for Bush Records document the organization's activism during the early 2000s critiquing politicians supporting policies that disproportionately benefitted corporations and the upper-class. The majority of the materials in this collection document the group's street theater and other actions during the 2000 and 2004 United States presidential elections. Materials in this collection include photographs (both print and digital), correspondence between organizers, printed suggestions for participating, flyers for distribution at actions, drafts of public statements, promotional ephemera like brochures or stickers, notes from planning meetings, and newspaper clippings. These materials document many of the group's targeted actions, such as "Block the Vote" that satirized voter suppression tactics, the "Get on the Limo" campaign tour, and "Cheney is Innocent." The collection also includes costumes and accessories worn or used by activists during actions, including banners, tuxedos, buttons, a fur stole, a top hat, plastic cigars, and cufflinks. In addition to documenting specific activism during the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, the collection reveals a larger context of activism against economic inequality, as well as the tactics used by the organization, such as culture jamming and street theater. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Immediately after acquisition, the collection was bagged and frozen for two weeks in a freezer without cycle to eliminate any insect activity. Textiles were vacuumed, measured, and rehoused in storage appropriate to their size, material, and condition. Smaller items, such as bowties, cufflinks, and plastic cigars were wrapped in buffered tissue paper and folded inside a smaller Paige box. Foam core posters were tested for cleaning with water. As per curator's direction, duplicate vinyl banners, paper and foam core posters were removed and discarded. </p><p> Following cleaning and rehousing, materials were described on the collection-level with a box- and folder-level container list, re-using partial inventories created by Preservation staff. </p><p> Born-digital files on optical discks were identified, inventoried, and described but have not yet been forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. These items have been physically removed from their original boxes and replaced with a separation sheet. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. </p><p> Audiovisual items from this collection (previously represented in this record as Series V. Audiovisual Materials, Boxes 9-10) were deaccessioned and transferred to New York University's Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics in November 2017. </p>
