    <p>Paul O'Dwyer (1907-1998) was an Irish politician and lawyer based in New York City active in numerous Irish American organizations who frequently worked cases concerning human rights and progressive causes. He was one of the founders of the O'Dwyer & Bernstien law firm in Manhattan, often working workers' rights, human rights, and civil rights cases. Although his interest in progressive causes was broad, he was especially involved and committed to conflict in Northern Ireland in the late 20th century. The collection documents his personal, political, and professional activities, including personal correspondence, in which personal matters and relationships are inextricably intertwined with political activism and professional activities; subject files, which cover topics concerning civil rights, human rights, Irish American organizations, the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the United Nations, with specific emphasis on immigration and human rights issues; and the records of the Charles L. Keith and Clara Miller Foundation, displaying the interconnected nature of human rights and philanthropy in the city.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Paul O'Dwyer (1907-1998) was an Irish politician and lawyer based in New York City active in numerous Irish American organizations who frequently worked cases concerning human rights and progressive causes. He was born in Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland and later emigrated to Brooklyn, New York when he was 18. He was one of the founders of the O'Dwyer & Bernstien law firm in Manhattan, often working cases defending workers' rights, human rights, and civil rights. He was an active member of the National Lawyers' Guild, and served as the organization's president in 1947. He held numerous public positions, including New York City Council member and New York City Commissioner to the United Nations and Consular Corps. </p><p> Although his interest in progressive causes was broad, he was especially involved and committed to conflict in Northern Ireland in the late 20th century. O'Dwyer was a prominent member of many Irish American organizations that lobbied on behalf of nationalist causes and pressured American politicians to take a more active role in the peace process in Northern Ireland. In both an official and unofficial capacity, he focused on extradition and immigration cases. His older brother was New York City Mayor William O'Dwyer, and his son is lawyer Brian O'Dwyer. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The majority of the materials were in hanging files with accurate descriptive titles. As much as possible, these groupings and descriptions were retained. The subject files, for example, were originally organized in an alphabetical run, an order which has been retained here. Some materials were loose in boxes or in large folders that were either unlabeled or labeled "Miscellaneous." These materials were comprised of primarily personal correspondence and newspaper articles. Due to the large volume of personal correspondence, these materials were roughly sorted alphabetically for ease of access and use. Loose materials pertaining to specific topics or organizations were interfiled into the alphabetical subject files run, as appropriate. Proposals to the Charles L. Keith and Clara Miller Foundation had no original order; due to the large volume, these were roughly sorted alphabetically for ease of access and use. </p><p> The collection was rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes, and described by an archivist. Extensive duplicates were discarded if not annotated. </p>
