    <p>The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU) was founded in 1934, in Tyronza, Arkansas by an interracial assembly of eighteen local sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Despite extreme persecution by landowners and deputy sheriffs the movement quickly developed locals in communities throughout the delta region and beyond. The STFU numbered 31,000 members at its peak in 1938. Several agricultural strikes and two roadside encampments-highlighting the plight of agricultural workers-garnered national press coverage. State commissions were established to relieve the plight of sharecroppers in Arkansas and neighboring Missouri and federal legislation was passed, creating programs to underwrite loans for sharecroppers to buy their own farms, as well as programs to build emergency housing for agricultural laborers. This collection consists of several hundred slide photographs, approximately ninety audio cassettes, sixty video cassettes, a dozen reel to reel tapes and a dozen 16mm films. The slides document sharecroppers, STFU leaders and rank-and-file members, and the devastation in Depression-era Dust Bowl farms. The film, video and reel to reel tape recording were generated in the course of filming the documentary "Our Land Too" on the history of the STFU.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> The Southern Tenant Farmers' Union was founded in 1934, in Tyronza, Arkansas, a rural town in northeast Arkansas. The region up until the 1930s was fertile and impoverished, consisting primarily of cotton plantations own by a small number of land owners. Sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and agricultural laborers worked the land. Sharecroppers were provided seed, tools, a shack to live in and credit to buy food and clothing. They turned over half their crop to the landowner. Tenant farmers provided their own tools and seed, turning over one third of their crop to the landowner. Agricultural laborers worked the landowners' land for small wages. </p><p> The New Deal agricultural subsidy programs redistributed income towards the landowners, at the expense of the sharecroppers and laborers working the land. With this miscarriage of policy as their impetus, H.L. Mitchell and Henry Clay East, two self-taught socialists, who ran a laundry and filing station respectively, in Tyronza, began talking up socialist alternatives to the agricultural system in operation in much of the Arkansas delta. The first meeting of the STFU, on July 13th 1934, was attended by an interracial assembly of eighteen local sharecroppers and tenant farmers. </p><p> Despite extreme persecution by landowners and deputy sheriffs the STFU quickly developed locals in communities throughout the delta region and beyond. The STFU numbered 31,000 members at its peak in 1938, and parleyed support from socialist leader Norman Thomas, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rheinhold Niebuhr, Gardner Jackson (working in 1934 for the Department of Agriculture), and others to obtain the ear of federal agricultural policy makers. </p><p> Enduring shootings, beating and near-lynchings, the STFU obtained a great deal of press coverage. A "March of Time" newsreel was made in 1935 about sharecroppers. Several agricultural strikes and two roadside encampments-highlighting the plight of agricultural workers-garnered national press coverage. State commissions were established to relieve the plight of sharecroppers in Arkansas and neighboring Missouri and federal legislation was passed: the STFU influenced the creations of programs to underwrite loans for sharecroppers to buy their own farms, and to build emergency housing for agricultural laborers. </p><p> The STFU is also memorable for the quasi-religious character the movement assumed. The union had its own anthems and fighting songs ("Roll the Union On," was composed by STFU member John Handcox). It had elaborate rituals: "The Ceremony of the Land," and a string-tying initiation ceremony. Principles of racial equality were espoused from the beginning of the STFU, making it one of the first interracial organizations of working people to function in the southern United States. </p>

      <p> This collection consists of several hundred slide photographs, approximately ninety audio cassettes, sixty video cassettes, a dozen reel to reel tapes and a dozen 16mm films. The slides document sharecroppers, Southern Tenant Farmers' Union (STFU) leaders and rank-and-file members, and the devastation in Depression-era Dust Bowl farms. Prominent photographers such as Margaret Bourke-White, Dorothea Lange and Farm Security Administration photographers are included. Audio cassette recordings include a small number of interviews with STFU organizers as well as lectures given by H.L. Mitchell and others at U.S. college campuses.  The film, video and reel to reel tape recording were generated in the course of filming the documentary "Our Land Too" on the history of the STFU. </p>

  <div>
      <p> This collection was originally divided into four separate collections: Southern Tenant Farmers' Union Films (FILMS 006), Oral History (OH 029), Photographs (PHOTOS 225) and Videos (VIDEOS 004). In 2014 these were reunited into a single collection, the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union Collection (WAG 329).  </p><p> The majority of reels, audio and video cassettes in this collection have individual identification numbers. These numbers were assigned before the collection was donated to the Tamiment Library. The collection was later weeded due to the substantial number of duplicates. As a result, particularly in the audio recordings, there are frequent gaps in the numerical sequence of the individual cassettes.  </p><p> Finally, when the collection was intially donated, an extensive item level inventory was created which contains some additional information not reflected in this finding aid. This inventory is available at the respository.  </p>
