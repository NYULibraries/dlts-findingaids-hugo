    <p>The official organ of the Communist Party, USA, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker's</span> editorial positions reflected the policies of the Communist Party.  At the same time the paper also attempted to speak to the broad left-wing community in the United States that included labor, civil rights, and peace activists, with stories covering a wide range of events, organizations and individuals in the United States and around the world.  As a daily newspaper, it covered the major stories of the twentieth century. However, the paper always placed an emphasis on radical social movements, social and economic conditions particularly in working class and minority communities, poverty, labor struggles, racial discrimination, right wing extremism with an emphasis on fascist and Nazi movements, and of course the Soviet Union and the world-wide Communist movement. The paper has had a succession of names and has been published in varying frequences between daily to weekly over the course of its existence. In 2010 it ceased print publication and became an electronic, online-only, weekly publication titled the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">People's World</span>.  The bulk of the collection consists of printed photographic images produced through a variety of processes, collected by the photography editors of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> and its successor newspapers as a means of maintaining an organized collection of images for use in publication. Images of many important people, groups and events associated with the CPUSA and the American Left are present in the collection, including many local and national labor unions, particularly those affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> The <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> traces its origins to the Communist Labor Party, founded in Chicago in 1919, and its newspaper the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Toiler</span>. When the Communist Labor Party merged with the Workers Party in 1921 the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Toiler</span> became the weekly paper <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Worker</span>.  On January 13, 1924 it changed its name to the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span>.  It continued to be published in Chicago until 1927, when the Communist Party moved to New York City. As the official organ of the Communist Party, USA, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker's</span> editorial positions reflected the policies of the Communist Party.  At the same time the paper also attempted to speak to the broad left-wing community in the United States that included labor, civil rights, and peace activists, with stories covering a wide range of events, organizations and individuals in the United States and around the world.  As a daily newspaper, it covered the major stories of the twentieth century. However, there was always an emphasis on radical social movements, social and economic conditions particularly in working class and minority communities, poverty, labor struggles, racial discrimination, right wing extremism with an emphasis on fascist and Nazi movements, and of course the Soviet Union and the world-wide Communist movement. </p><p> After the Communist Party moved its operations to New York City the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> became one of the most influential papers on the American Left. In the late 1920s its circulation was estimated at 17,000 and at its peak in the late 1930s it may have been as high as 35,000.  </p><p> In October 1935 the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> began to publish a Sunday edition, later known as the Sunday Worker. That same year, it also added comic strips such as Louis Furstadt's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Little Lefty</span>, a countercultural retort to the mainstream press' <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Little Orphan Annie</span>.  In 1938 it added a women's page edited by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. Over the years, the paper would publish the work of many notable graphic artists and cartoonists, including prominent figures such as Fred Ellis, who also contributed artwork <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The New Majority</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Liberator</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Labor Herald</span>; radical illustrator and muralist Hugo Gellert; painter, journalist and cartoonist Robert Minor; and Ollie Harrington, an African American cartoonist who lived in exile in East Germany for much of his life. </p><p> In the mid-1930s the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> established a sports page that combined extensive sports coverage with incisive social criticism. Sports page editor Lester Rodney led the campaign for the desegregation of professional sports in the United States, particularly baseball. Featuring regular articles on the accomplishments of African American athletes, such as Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> made the case that all sports would benefit from integration. As part of this campaign it sponsored a basketball team made up of Harlem's top high school players and persuaded a black professional football team to play a benefit game to raise funds for the paper.  </p><p> With their leadership role in the Southern Negro Youth Congress, the Communist Party and the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> played a central role in the early civil rights movement and the anti-lynching campaigns of the 1930s and 1940s, including the campaign to free the Scottsboro Boys, the Angelo Herndon trial, and the work of the International Labor Defense. The <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> denounced the Jim Crow laws of the Southern United States, focusing its coverage on violence directed against the black community and on the emerging struggles to end segregation and racial intimidation.  </p><p> The <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker's</span> coverage of the unemployment marches in the early years of the Great Depression and the fight for social security and unemployment insurance made it one of the most influential papers on the American Left. Its coverage of the labor battles of the 1930s shaped the way many Americans thought about organized labor. Its reporters and photographers captured the struggles textile workers in Gastonia, North Carolina in 1929; Illinois miners in 1930; California lettuce workers and Flint, Michigan autoworkers in 1931; coal miners in Harlan County, West Virginia ("Bloody Harlan") and teamsters in Minneapolis in 1934. During these years, the paper also documented the impact of the Great Depression on American working people, with stories on housing conditions in Harlem, Hunger Marches and unemployed movement organizing across the country, the campaign for social security, the "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work Campaign," and mobilizations for improved housing.  The paper was noted for its investigative reporting about slum housing and block busting in Harlem. Civil rights was an important part of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker's</span> agenda and the paper covered most of the major lynching cases of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The campaign to free the Scottsboro Boys was on its front pages for nearly seven years. </p><p> The news coverage in the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> almost always reflected Communist Party policies. During the Trade Union Educational League years of the 1920s this meant support for revolutionary unionism. During the Popular Front years the paper was a leading voice for industrial unionism and the Congress for Industrial Organizations.  </p><p> As the organ for the Communist Party, USA the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> provided extensive coverage about the international Communist movement. For the Communist Party the Soviet Union was the center of the world's revolutionary movement. The <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker's</span> coverage of Soviet life, foreign, and domestic policies reflected an uncritical perspective on the Soviet system, as it celebrated life in what it called the "Socialist" countries. These stories often highlighted the miracles of Soviet economic development and ethnic harmony under Socialism. This internationalist perspective often resulted in extensive coverage of the struggles for declonialization in Asia, Africa, and Latin America which were largely invisible in the mainstream press. The <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> often focused on revolutionary nationalism in its various forms from Pan Africanism to the self determination struggles in the Middle East. </p><p> With the ascendancy of Adolph Hitler, the fight against Nazism and fascism moved to the center of the Communist Party's agenda in the late 1930s. It reported on Nazi atrocities, and the rising tide of anti-Semitism. In 1936 the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> sent teams of photographers and reporters to Spain, as it tried to rally the American people to support the Spanish Republic in its brutal civil war with the Falange of General Francisco Franco. These teams returned with images and stories depicting the lives of ordinary Spanish people resisting fascism, the relationship between the Republican army and the International Brigades, and the impact of the fascist bombing in cities such as Guernica.  </p><p> With the fall of Spain and the signing of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact, the CPUSA aligned itself with the new course in Soviet foreign policy, as World War II became an "imperialist war." Between September 1939 and June 1941, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> refocused on the domestic scene and the peace movement as a way of trying to divert attention from the Soviet Union's pact with Germany. The paper highlighted campaigns for union rights, job security, and civil liberties.  </p><p> When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June of 1941, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker's</span> interpretation of the war changed dramatically. The message, as depicted in the articles and photography of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span>, became World War II as an epic struggle against the Nazis, the role of the Soviet Union as the major battlefield of the war, and the impact of the German invasion on Russia's civilian population.  On the cultural front, the paper documented the relationship between politics, folk music and folk dance, covering individuals such as Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Leadbelly, Sophie Maslow and Martha Graham.  </p><p> However, the post-war period saw the rise of McCarthyism and the Communist Party under relentless attack. As a result, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> experienced a dramatic decrease in circulation and the paper's financial health, always tenuous at best, took a decided turn for the worse. The daily paper closed in January 1958 during the period when the Communist Party was forced to go underground as a result of the repression of the Red Scare. In 1960 it resumed publication as a weekly under the name of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Worker</span> and, although it began biweekly publication several years later, it never again achieved the level of popularity or circulation it enjoyed in the 1930s and 1940s. </p><p> In 1967 the paper, now renamed the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily World</span>, resumed daily publication. It reported on the rebirth of the civil rights movement, including sit-ins, voter registration campaigns and the Freedom Rides, following figures including Martin Luther King, Jr, Ralph Abernathy, Rosa Parks and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. In the late 1960s and 1970s, as the CPUSA aligned itself with the anti-Vietnam War movement and Black Nationalist movements including the Black Panthers, the paper covered important events of that period, including the Soledad Brothers trial, the subsequent arrest and imprisonment of Angela Davis, demonstrations against the war in Vietnam – including massive Moratorium Day demonstrations – on college campuses in New York City and across the country, and the Black Panther Breakfast Program in Harlem.  </p><p> In 1986 the paper merged with the CPUSA's West Coast weekly, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">People's World</span>. The newly formed <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">People's Daily World</span> was published from 1987 until 1991, when daily publication was abandoned in favor of a weekly edition, renamed the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">People's Weekly World</span>. During this period the paper focused heavily on labor union activity, particularly in cities like Detroit and Chicago, as well as the growing anti-globalization movement.  </p><p> Shifting its operations back to Chicago between 2001 and 2002, the paper changed its name to the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">People's World</span> in 2009. In 2010, the paper ceased print publication and became an electronic, online-only, publication. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The collection contains approximately 670,000 photographic negatives in 4 x 5, 8 x 10, 120, 127 and 35 millimeter formats, contact sheets and log sheets related to the 35 millimeter negatives, and several hundred slides. Although materials in the collection were gathered throughout the life of the paper, the bulk of the material dates from 1930 to 1948 and from 1968 to 1990. </p><p> The collection was created by the photography editors of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> and its successor newspapers as a means of maintaining an organized collection of images for use in publication. The negatives were mostly shot by <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily World</span> staff photographers. During the 1930s and 1940s photographers identified simply as "Art" and "Pete" (whose full name was Peter Aprievesky) took almost all of the photographs for the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span>. In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of individuals served as staff photographers, including Bill Andrews, Ted Reich, Terry Santana, Sheldon Ramsdell, and Mike Giocondo. Many of these individuals also wrote for the paper or, as in the case of Bill Andrews, provided editorial cartoons or other artwork for publication. In the 1980s and 1990s, the newspaper published images from a number of photographers across the country, including long-time staff photographer Ken BeSaw, former editor Tim Wheeler, and Maxine Orris. A few additional negatives were sent to the paper by readers and other individuals. Slides were also largely shot by staff photographers, but the collection does contain a few commercially-produced thematic slide sets, mostly from the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries.  </p><p> Although the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily World</span> Negatives Collection has the same provenance as the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily World</span> Photographs Collection, the content of the two collections varies substantially, particularly in regards to photographs taken during the 1930s and 1940s. Images from this period focus heavily on the activities of organized labor and relationship of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) to local and national labor unions, particularly those affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Many of these photographs depict strikes (or demonstrations in support of strikers), including the Transport Workers Union (TWU) taxi strike of 1940 and bus strike of 1941, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers picketing the Phelps-Dodge Copper Products Corporation in 1941, Whelan Drug Store workers strikes throughout the 1940s, and employees of Western Union on strike in 1946. There are also numerous photographs of membership meetings, election and installation of officers for unions including Local 65 of the United Automobile Workers, the American Federation of Teachers, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), the International Fur and Leather Workers' Union, the International Brotherhood of Painters, and the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE). Also included are photographs of rank and file members on the job, as well as portraits of union leaders, including CIO President Philip Murray, International Brotherhood of Painters rank and file leader Louis Weinstock and National Maritime Union (NMU) President Joseph Curran. In addition, the broad range of union activity during this period is also well-documented in photographs of social events such as dances, fashion shows, band rehearsals, parties and sports competitions sponsored by the NMU, TWU and the Sperry Local of the UE. The political activities of labor unions are also well represented. Images from this period show union contingents in May Day, St. Patrick's Day and Union Label parades. Campaigns to free officers of the International Fur and Leather Workers Union jailed under the Sherman Anti-Trust act; against the Rapp-Coudert Committee's investigations of teachers including Morris Schappes; and union-sponsored demonstrations in support of opening a Second Front during World War II are depicted. In keeping with the Daily Worker's promotion of racial equality, there are also a number of photographs of African American workers in various trades, as well as images of interracial union activity including an October 1945 student strike at Benjamin Franklin High School in Harlem. </p><p> This part of the collection also contains a number of photographs documenting activities supporting the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. These include mass demonstrations held in Madison Square Garden; painter Rockwell Kent creating artwork to raise funds for relief; medicine, food and other relief supplies being sent to Spain; and veterans of the war, including members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, returning from Spain. </p><p> This early portion of the collection is particularly significant because, in most cases, there are no matching prints for negatives from the 1930s and 1940s. However, negatives from the years after 1968 generally have corresponding prints.  </p><p> Images of CPUSA activities, leaders, members, and affiliated organizations form the majority of this later portion of collection. These include portraits of CPUSA leaders such as Chairmen Gus Hall and Henry Winston as well as Vice-Presidential candidates Angela Davis and Jarvis Tyner. There are also photographs of CPUSA conventions and demonstrations, including meetings and demonstrations of the Young Workers Liberation League, Young Communist League and W. E. B. Du Bois Clubs. </p><p> There are also a significant number of photos from the 1960s and 1970s documenting individuals associated with the American Left, such as Mark Rudd, Abbie Hoffman, Stokely Carmichael, John Kerry (at the time an antiwar activist) and H. Rap Brown. The Black Power movement in New York is well documented with photographs of the Black Panther's Breakfast Program in Harlem and New York City police raiding Louis Farrakhan's Muslim Mosque. There are a large number of photographs of demonstrations against the war in Vietnam – including massive Moratorium Day demonstrations – on college campuses in New York City and across the country. There are also pictures of physical conflicts between antiwar protesters and "hardhat" conservative union construction workers in May 1970. Also included are photos of actions by labor unions Postal Workers strikes of the 1970s, members of the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes picketing, and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) wildcat strike against the New York Joint Board of Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in 1971. </p><p> The <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily World</span> Negatives collection also differs significantly from the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily World</span> Photographs collection in terms of geographic scope. Since the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> was located in New York City for much of its existence, events and individuals outside of New York City were largely not covered by staff photographers. As a result, the negatives contain relatively few images of subjects and events outside of the New York City metropolitan area, but a large number of photographs documenting New York City-based activities and individuals. These include political figures such as Paul O'Dwyer, Adam Clayton Powell, Bella Abzug, John Lindsay, Nelson Rockefeller, Percy Sutton, Jacob Javits, Charles Rangel, and Vito Marcantonio. The collection also contains images relating to the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school decentralization dispute, including photographs of leaders such as Rhody McCoy and C. Herbert Oliver. Photographs document a wide variety of events in the New York City metropolitan area, from St. Patrick's Day parades to the annual New York City Marathon, Apollo mission astronauts being feted at City Hall to Aretha Franklin in concert at the Apollo Theater. Photographs of ice cream trucks, New Jersey's Palisades Park amusement park, public school openings, the Brooklyn-Long Island Cat Show and pictures shot for the paper's women's page demonstrating the proper technique for broiling a chicken are all included.  </p><p> The arts and culture are documented throughout the collection, with images of popular music performances and performers, including jazz musicians at the Village Vanguard in 1939; an 1967 appearance by Ravi Shankar at City College; a 1949 hootenanny featuring Paul Robeson, Pete Seeger and Lee Hays; a 1968 Carnegie Hall tribute concert to Woody Guthrie featuring Bob Dylan and Judy Collins; and a 1968 W. E. B. Du Bois centennial meeting at Carnegie Hall whose participants included Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Baldwin. Also included are photos of celebrity supporters of liberal or left-wing political causes, mainly actors such as Paul Newman, Lauren Bacall, Dustin Hoffman, Ed Asner, Ossie Davis, and Ruby Dee. These photographs demonstrate the CPUSA's promotion of sympathetic artists and entertainers, as well as its ongoing interest in political music, dance and visual art. </p><p> Images related to professional sports and athletes, including, sports teams affiliated with labor unions, the Hermann Matern Sports School in the German Democratic Republic, and exhibition games between United States and Soviet Union teams are included in the collection. There are also photographs of athletes including iconoclastic baseball player Jim Bouton, and boxers Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali. </p><p> As part of the ongoing fight against fascism as perceived by the CPUSA, the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> also covered individuals, organizations, and events whose political viewpoints were opposed to the CPUSA's political perspectives and ideology. As a result, the collection includes images of the proto-Nazi German American Bund, as well as rallies supporting the presidential campaign of Alabama Governor George Wallace and pro-Vietnam war demonstrations. Demonstrations and incidents of violence leveled against CPUSA members by groups such as the Jewish Defense League and the National Caucus of Labor Committees are documented with numerous photographs.  </p><p> Since the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> covered events and individuals all over the world, the collection also includes some images from other countries, including include Cuba, Chile, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and the Soviet Union. From Chile, there are photographs of rural cooperative farms, as well as a 1971 May Day parade in Santiago whose participants include recently-elected Chilean president Salvador Allende. From Cuba, there are photographs of individuals including Che Guevara (with <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> journalist Joseph North in the early 1960s) and Fidel Castro, cultural groups such as percussion ensemble Los Papines, and events including as the 1970 Organization of Latin American Journalists conference and the 1978 World Festival of Youth and Students in Havana, Cuba. There are numerous pictures of the Soviet Union, many taken on CPUSA delegations. A large percentage of these picture CPUSA leaders including Gus Hall and Henry Winston, but there are also photographs of rural life in Tajikistan and the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. A number of significant international conferences, including the 1985 World Festival of Youth and Students, a 1988 United States-Soviet Union Friendship Summit in Moscow, and the 1963 World Congress of Women in Moscow are also documented.  </p>

  <div>
      <p> Materials were placed in new acid-free folders and boxes. Original caption information, when available, was transcribed onto negative sleeves. Where captions were illegible, the archivist's interpretation is enclosed in square brackets. The language of the original captions, which includes editorializing comments (e.g., "District 9 – Hoodlums," "Demonstrations Against Czech "invasion" by Socialist forces," "Right-wingers protest "anti-Semitism" in Soviet Union," "National Caucus of Labor Committee goons attack Center for Marxist Education," "Demonstration against Israeli aggression by students") was retained. Some anachronistic terms - particularly those referring to race, ethnicity, or sex, such as "Negro," "Black," "Girl" or "Boy" (where the image is clearly of a young woman or young man, rather than a child) - have been revised, except for a few selected instances in which these have been allowed to stand, for the value they offer as a window into the political and cultural flavor of a particular time.  </p><p> Shoot numbers for 35 millimeter negatives were originally assigned by <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> staff, and these numbers have been retained. However, no <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Daily Worker</span> shoot numbers were assigned to other negative formats, so shoot numbers were created for these materials by the archivist.  </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Arrangement</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The collection is arranged into six series: </p><p> Series I: 4 x 5, 120 and 127 Negatives, Series II: 35 Millimeter Negatives, Series III: 8 x 10 Negatives, Series IV: Slides, Series V: Log Sheets, Series VI: Contact Sheets </p><p> Series IV negatives are arranged alphabetically by shoot caption and Series V materials are arranged in chronological order.  Dated negatives in Series I through III and in Series VI are arranged chronologically, followed by undated negatives arranged alphabetically by caption.  In addition, all the negatives series in the collection may also be viewed in one combined list arranged in alphabetical order by caption, by clicking on the following link: <span class="ead-extref">http://library.nyu.edu/tamiment/dw_negs_sorted_by_shoot_title.pdf</span> </p><p> Captions are assigned to a shoot, which is a group of images shot by a photographer or team of photographers of one event, usually on the same day. Each shoot has a unique identifying number. The 4x5, 120, 127, and 8x10 format negatives have been assigned individual frame numbers within each shoot as well (making it possible for researchers to determine in advance the total number of images available in a given shoot). 35 millimeter negative shoots (and any corresponding log or contact sheets for them) do not have assigned individual frame numbers, but the total number of frames within each 35 millimeter shoot ranges from one single frame to several rolls comprising as many as 100 individual images, with an average of 36 frames images per shoot. </p><p> While the shoot numbers for the 35 millimeter negatives, contact sheets, and log sheets correspond to one another, none of these groups of materials completely match one another. That is, not all 35 millimeter negatives have corresponding contact sheets or log sheets and vice versa. </p>
