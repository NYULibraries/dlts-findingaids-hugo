  <div>
      <p> At the time of accessioning, materials were moved into archival housing. Periodicals were grouped roughly by title, but have not been further arranged. Other materials have been retained in their original groupings. Titles supplied by donor have been recorded when present, while other titles have been supplied by the archivist. </p><p> In April 2018, newspapers were unfolded and housed in oversize flat boxes.  The sound recording, t-shirt, and buttons were separated from the paper material and housed separately as appropriate.  Separation sheets were created to sustain the intellectual relationship between items. </p>
