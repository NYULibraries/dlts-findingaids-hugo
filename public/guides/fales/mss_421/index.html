Berkowitz continued to write about and advocate for safe sex through the 1980s into the 2000s.  The Richard Berkowitz Papers date from 1944 to 2015, with the bulk being between 1982-2015, and document his work as a writer, AIDS activist, and sex worker, as well as his family, his education, his medical history, and Daryl Wein's documentary about Berkowitz's life, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Sex Positive</span>.

  <div>
      <p> Richard Berkowitz (b. 1955) is a gay American author, AIDS activist, and former sex worker.  He graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in communications in 1977.  While at Rutgers, he wrote for the campus newspaper, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Daily Targum</span>, and organized the first gay rights protest in New Jersey in 1976.  After graduation, he attended New York University's (NYU) Graduate School of Film for one year.  He moved to the Chelsea neighborhood of New York and worked as a sex worker, specifically as an S&M dominant, between 1978 and 1982.   </p><p> In the late 1970s, Berkowitz met Dr. Joseph Sonnabend while seeking treatment at the Gay Men's Health Project clinic in New York City.   In 1982, Berkowitz was diagnosed with AIDS.  In laying out treatment options, Sonnabend shared his multifactorial theory of AIDS, which held that AIDS was caused by repeated exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in particular cytomegalovirus, and semen.  This theory was in opposition to the more widely held theory at the time that a single, new infectious agent was the cause of AIDS.  Berkowitz felt that gay men needed to know their risk of contracting AIDS and Sonnabend offered to introduce him to another of his patients with AIDS, Michael Callen, who was also interested in spreading this information to the gay community.  Together, the three men are credited with creating the concept of safe sex.  Berkowitz and Callen formed the support group Gay Men with AIDS and began writing about the multifactorial theory, AIDS, and safe sex.  They wrote "We Know Who We Are", a warning to sexually active gay men with AIDS in New York, (published in the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Native</span> in 1982) and the first safe sex guide, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach</span>, published in 1983.  They began making television appearances; speaking to support groups, legislators, and others; writing about AIDS; and were founding members of the People with AIDS Coalition. </p><p> Callen died in 1993 from AIDS-related complications.  Sonnabend co-founded the AIDS Medical Foundation in 1983, and continued writing about AIDS issues and serving in private practice until his retirement in 2005.  Berkowitz continued to write about AIDS, safe sex, and gay rights issues throughout the 1980s and into the 2000s.  He returned to sex work in the late 1980s, promoting himself as a safe sex S&M dominant in Florida and New York.  In 2003 he published his autobiography, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Stayin' Alive</span>, and in 2008 was the subject of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Sex Positive</span>, a documentary written and directed by Daryl Wein. </p>
