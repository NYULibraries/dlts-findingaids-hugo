    <p>Jerome Charyn was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1937, and since 1963 has published short stories such as: 'On Second Avenue,' and more than twenty novels, the first of which is entitled: 'Once Upon A Droshky.' His reputation as a major writer has been fueled in part by a disregard for the limitations of established literary genres and a unique approach to the historical, romance and detective novel. The Jerome Charyn Papers are comprised of his personal archive from the years: 1937-1997.</p></div>
