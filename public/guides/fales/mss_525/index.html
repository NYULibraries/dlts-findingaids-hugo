    <p>Harry Kondoleon (1955-1994) was an American playwright, novelist, and poet. Kondoleon was active in New York City's Downtown arts scene in the 1980s, and was one of the first and most prolific writers to engage creatively with the AIDS crisis as it decimated New York City's queer community.  The Harry Kondoleon Papers consists of materials created and collected by Kondoleon in the course of his professional life, and date from 1970 to 2016, with bulk of the material dating from 1977 to 1994.  The collection documents Kondoleon's creative process with handwritten notes, typed drafts and revisions in both paper and electronic format, and published scripts and novels.  The collection also includes Kondoleon's diaries, correspondence, newspaper and magazine clippings, audiovisual recordings, photographs, and subject files used as research or source material in Kondoleon's writing process.</p></div>

His plays include <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Vampires</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Zero Positive</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Brides</span>, and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Houseguests</span>, and his novels include <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Whore of Tjampuan</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Diary of a Lost Boy</span>.

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Custodial History</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection was compiled from material held by Kondoleon's family and friends.  After Kondoleon's death in 1994, his sister, Christine Kondoleon, took custody of a large portion of the collection.  She added materials from their parents's home Queens, New York.  A core group of materials, including notebooks and manuscripts, was reviewed and arranged by Don Shewey, one of Kondoleon's close friends.  Stephen Soba contributed his collection of correspondence from Kondoleon.  Prior to their transfer to New York University, materials were assessed and reviewed by Fales Librarian for Archival Collections Nicholas Martin at the homes of Christine Kondoleon and Stephen Soba; during those visits materials were packed and curatorial decisions were made. The materials that comprise this collection were transferred from Christine Kondoleon's home in Cambridge, Massachusetts to the Fales Library at New York University. </p>
