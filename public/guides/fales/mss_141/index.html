  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Playwright, writer and director Arthur Lee Kopit was born in 1937 in New York City. His first plays were staged while still an undergraduate at Harvard University. He recieved public and critical attention with his play "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad: A Pseudoclassical Tragifarce in a Bastard French Tradition". Written while still in school, the play was published when Kopit was 23 and went on to productions in London and New York establishing his reputation for fusing disparate genres, absurdism, and a darkly comic world view. Later notable plays include "Indians" (1968), simultaneously a review of America's treatment of Native Americans and a critique of the Vietnam War; "Wings" (1978), a more somber story of a stroke victim's recovery; and "The End of the World" (1984), a mordant investigation of the arms race and nuclear destruction. </p><p> Additionally, Kopit has written works for television and radio and books for musicals, often collaborating on the latter with composer and lyricist Maury Yeston. These works include "Nine" (1982), an adaptation of the Federico Fellini's film "8 1/2", and "Phantom" (1991), a musical version of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Phantom of the Opera</span> by Gaston Leroux that has been overshadowed by the more popular (though less critically acclaimed) version by Andrew Lloyd Weber. </p><p> Kopit has taught at Wesleyan University, Yale University, and the City College of New York and has been the recipient of numerous awards, grants and fellowships. He currently resides in New York City. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Arthur Kopit Papers contain the professional, personal and electronic records covering Kopit's career as a playwright. Kopit began his career while still a student at Harvard, quickly leapt to fame, and continued to produce major works for four decades. This collection thoroughly documents all aspects of his career from work on the stage, in the film industry, and on television. A tireless writer, the collection contains thorough documentation on numerous unproduced works for all media. Records also document Kopit's teaching work, his personal and family life and provide a solid picture of the theater world. </p><p> The collection is divided into series as organized by the collection creator. The major series are Projects, Media, Business Files, and Personal Records. The arrangement within each series varies according to how the materials were organized by the creator and received by the depository. </p><p> The first series, Projects, is also the largest series, comprising half the collection. The materials are organized alphabetically by project title as there was no order between them. Named project files go back no further than the late 1960's and thus do not include material on the early part of Kopit's career. </p><p> The materials for each project present are in no particular order yet the materials fall into identifiable categories. The first category would be books, pamphlets, magazines, newspaper articles, journals, and any other material used as research for the project. This can include government publications in the case of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">End of the World</span>, or commercial pamphlets in the case of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Dream House</span>. Many of the projects contain numerous tapes of interviews with experts, knowledgeable sources or persons relevant to the project's topic. Kopit also seemed to record reflections, notes and thoughts on tape. </p><p> The second category would be handwritten drafts of the plays including preliminary outlines, diagrams, and sketches. Kopit worked extensively with index cards to structure the play or piece. He also made use of large sketchbooks and blank notebooks to write out ideas and schematize the work. There are indications that these cards and loose pages would be assembled on bulletin boards or compared against each other to map out the development of a work. </p><p> Typewritten drafts make up a large portion of each project's files. Whole scripts as produced, annotated early drafts, and many partial copies of various successive versions tend to be present for each work. In some cases, later productions of the work have their own alterations and unique copies of the script. </p><p> Lastly, project files contain correspondence with involved parties, contracts, photographs, promotional materials, material on casting, royalty agreements, publication material, copyright records and other files. These types of material are not as present in each project as the above types but still make regular appearances. </p><p> The first part of the series consists of projects with enough records to occupy one more whole boxes. The second part of the series, titled miscellaneous works, are the records of productions taking up less than a single box. While these materials reflect all periods of Kopit's career, there is a particular presence of materials from earlier in his career. These are works which either did not require as much research and preparatory work as later projects, or for which more extensive documentation was never retained. Works documented here include "The Questioning of Nick", "Oh Dad, Poor Dad...", "The Day the Whores Came Out to Play Tennis...", "Mhil'daiim", "Secrets of the Rich", "Snatch", "Chamber Music", "What's Happened to the Thorne's House?", "On the Runway of Life You Never Know What's Coming Off Next", "An Incident in the Park", "Promontory Point Revisited", and "The Conquest of Everest". Some obscure unproduced works are present including a proposal and drafts of a screenplay or novel entitled "Fresh Game", works entitled "The Frog", "The Poet", "Fat City", "Edgar's Exploits" and other untitled and unidentified works. </p><p> Series II: Media, consist of newspapers, magazines, and videotapes not found with or attached to any particular work. They are described as found. A large quantity of computer media is present. Apart from back up disks of operating systems and programs, the majority of the computer media is labeled disks of Kopit's project work. An additional body of media remains originating from leslie Garis and Kopit's children. </p><p> Series III: Business Records is composed of files originally kept in filing cabinets and most often coming out of labeled folders and hanging files. These records are in discrete groups, whether by particular location or time period. Groups overlap in subject and nature of the records. Many business files resemble the project files in that they contain notes and research, correspondence relating to projects, productions, rights, royalties and publication. The business files also contain personal financial records including bank account statements, bills, receipts, ledgers, investment records, and home maintenance and property documents. </p><p> Series IV: Personal records contains important documentation on Kopit's early life and professional career. While real juvenilia exists here including grade school and high school materials, papers, reports and notebooks, Kopit wrote numerous plays while still in college that went on to be professionally staged and published. Early drafts of works, correspondence relating both to school and writing, documents of Kopit's activities leading up to and past the Broadway premier of "Oh dad, Poor Dad..." and records running until the late 1960s are present here. Kopit kept voluminous scrapbooks of news clippings documenting the success of his plays and his rise in the New York theater world and society. A significant amount of records are present from his parents, a successful couple in New York City whose lives were closely intertwined with Kopit's during these decades. </p><p> Series V: Miscellaneous is composed of two boxes of materials not easily identifiable or attributable to any specific project. It is likely that these two boxes will be assimilated into the above series upon further processing. </p><p> Series VI: Other Author's Works comprises manuscripts of plays, short stories, story treatments, novels and books by other people. Some of these individuals may have been students, friends or professional associates of Kopit. Some are people Kopit had worked with or planned to work with. Yet others may have been unsolicited manuscripts. They are in order as found. </p><p> Series VII: The material in this series was deaccessioned. </p><p> Flat boxes at the end of the collection contain oversized material separated from other series. Box description contain notes on separated materials and the materials are labeled as to their origin. </p>

  <div>
      <p> There are five boxes of books separated from the Kopit collection. One box contains books of Kopit's published plays and works. Other books were either used by Kopit for research or simply ones collected for personal use. These books were only separated from the collection when they were not related to any project work or known or supposed to have been used for project research yet not found with or next to any project or project materials. Relevant books found among project materials were left in place. Additionally, two boxes of duplicated books, mostly multiple copies of Kopit's published plays, were removed from the collection.
