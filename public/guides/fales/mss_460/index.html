The producers represented in the collection are Klara Andersson, Orieta Chrem, Julie Covello, Friederike Jäger, Julie Kathryn, Minami Kato, K. Marie Kim, Dion McKenzie, Franziska Plückhan, Pauchi Sasaki, and Gisela Fullá Silvestre.

The interviews were conducted in New York, Germany, and Peru.  The website includes brief biographies, edited interviews, and video recordings of performances for 12 female music producers.  The spreadsheets include information about the producers, including the type of music they create, the hardware and software they use to create the music, and where they live and work. </p>
