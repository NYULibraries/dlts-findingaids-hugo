  <div>
      <p> Sylvère Lotringer is a literary critic and cultural theorist. He is best known for founding the journal Semiotext(e), which is largely credited with introducing the work of French theorists like Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze,Paul Virilio, Felix Guattari, Michel Foucault and Jean-Francois Lyotard to an English-speaking audience.<br> </p><p> Lotringer was born in Paris to Polish-Jewish immigrants. He spent the Nazi occupation of Paris as a "hidden child", later relocating with his family to Israel. He returned to Paris and studied at  the Sorbonne, where he founded the literary magazine L'Etrave. In 1964, Lotringer entered the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on Virginia Woolf's novels under the supervision of Roland Barthes and Lucien Goldmann. During this period he organized conferences at the Maison des Lettres of the Sorbonne where he forged connections with French literary critics, sociologists and writers as well as with the Bloomsbury Group in London (Leonard Woolf, T.S. Eliot, Vita Sackville-West, David Garnet, etc.) as a freelance writer for Louis Aragon's journal Les Lettres Francaises.<br> </p><p> After teaching in Scotland, Turkey, Australia and the American Midwest, Lotringer joined the French and Comparative Literature Faculty at Columbia University in 1972, where he eventually became Professor Emeritus. In 1973, Lotringer founded the journal Semiotext(e) with a group of Columbia University graduate students. After three scholarly, bilingual issues on semiotics, Lotringer and his group organized the controversial "Schizo-Culture" conference in 1975 at Columbia University, which featured Felix Guattari, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Francois Lyotard, Ronald D. Laing, Ti-Grace Atkinson, John Cage and William Burroughs,  among others. In 1978, Lotringer staged "The Nova Convention", a large event that gathered in downtown New York most of the American counter-culture (from Patti Smith and Timothy Leary to Franz Zappa, Laurie Anderson and Allen Ginsberg) as an homage to William S. Burroughs.<br> </p><p> Subsequent issues of Semiotext(e) moved away from the original scholarly format, enlisting a crew of artists and featuring experimental typographics, controversial topics and an ever-expanding cast of French theorists. In 1983, Lotringer founded Semiotext(e)'s Foreign Agents series to present their work in a portable book format stripped of the usual academic introductions and afterwords.  In 1990, as "French Theory" became established in America, Chris Kraus added the Native Agents book series --  meant to present home-grown fiction writers as American counterparts to the French theorists -- to Semiotext(e)'s output. Later, Lotringer  expanded Semiotext(e)'s roster to include an Active Agents series featuring, among others, the Black Panthers. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The Sylvère Lotringer Papers and Semiotext(e) Archive includes correspondence, manuscripts, clippings, financial records, and audiovisual material associated with Lotringer's work as a literary critic and cultural theorist, and as the founder of the journal and independent press Semiotext(e). The collection is arranged into <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">13 Series</span>: </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES I: Correspondence</span> contains both Sylvère Lotringer's personal correspondence and the correspondence of the Semiotext(e) group. It has been arranged into five subseries: Correspondence from Individuals; Organizations; Unknown Senders; Flyers; and Press Releases and Address Books. This series does not contain all the correspondence in the archive. Correspondence that was found foldered with a particular manuscript or project has been retained in its original position. </p><p> In <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries A: Individuals</span> materials have been arranged alphabetically by name of sender--or recipient in the case of drafts of letters written by Sylvère Lotringer. Because this series contains both Sylvère's personal correspondence and that of Semiotext(e), it includes letters addressed to recipients other than Sylvère, such as Jim Fleming and Chris Kraus. These letters are nevertheless filed under the name of their sender. Where a sender has an important affiliation to a magazine or institution, this information has been noted in parentheses; such information is meant to be helpful but is not exhaustive. Correspondence with organizations and institutions that is business-oriented rather than personal can be found in Subseries B; however, such separations are not entirely firm. Files may include manuscripts, photographs and other material that was included with the letters. Materials in each folder are arranged chronologically, with undated materials at the end. </p><p> In <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries B: Organizations</span> materials have been arranged alphabetically by name of sender-organzation. Files may include manuscripts, photographs and other material that was included with the letters. Materials in each folder are arranged chronologically, with undated materials at the end. </p><p> The materials in <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries C: Unknown Senders</span> are arranged chronologically, with undated materials at the end. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries D: Flyers, Press Releases and Mass-mailouts</span> contains flyers, press-releases, posters, invitations and other non-unique correspondence materials. Materials are arranged alphabetically by the name of the sender organization or host venue. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries E: Address Books</span> contains address books as well as business cards and loose addresses and envelopes. Folders are arranged alphabetically by title. Business cards are arranged alphabetically, but all other material is in no particular order. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES II: Semiotext(e) Projects</span> contains correspondence, documents, manuscripts and publications, and promotional material for the projects of the Semiotext(e) group. Subseries A holds material on the issues of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span> periodical, as well as conferences and events put on by the group. This subseries also contains materials relating to the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span> anthologies that reprint work from the earlier issues. Subseries B contains material relating to the Foreign, Native, and Active Agents book series, while Subseries C contains more general administrative files for the Semiotext(e) group. </p><p> The items in <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries A: Issues and Conferences</span> are arranged chronologically. The three large unfinished projects--the Panic, Japan, and Flesh-Eating Technologies Issues--have been listed by approximate date range and are grouped together. Often there is significant overlap between issues and conferences, with one growing out of the other. In such cases, materials have been placed with the best fit. Among the materials one can expect to find correspondence; notes, clippings and visual source material; manuscripts; layouts; flyers; and press clippings. Materials for each issue or conference is alphabetical by folder description. Material belonging to unidentified projects is found in the last folders in the series. </p><p> In <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries B: Foreign, Native and Active Agents Books</span>, the three book series are arranged chronologically by their founding date. Within each book series, materials are arranged chronologically by book title, with general and undated materials at the end. The date for unfinished projects is estimated. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries C: Administrative Files</span> contains administrative material like agreements, order forms, and stock counts arranged alphabetically by folder title. This subseries also contains the bulk of the information on <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span>'s relations with publishers Autonomedia and MIT Press. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES III: Manuscripts from the Semiotext(e) Archive</span> holds manuscripts found throughout the Semiotext(e) archive that could not be definitively linked to a specific issue of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span> periodical. It contains manuscripts for many of the Native Agents books as well as translations, interview transcripts and film scripts. It is divided into two subseries, for solicited and unsolicited manuscripts. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries A: Manuscripts</span> contains manuscripts found throughout the Semiotext(e) archive, as well as interviews conducted by Sylvère Lotringer, filed under the name of the interviewee. Materials are arranged alphabetically by author, and chronologically when the dates for several works by the same author are known. Translator's names appear in parentheses when known. If a work is untitled or if additional information about the work was given on the original folder, this information appears in parentheses. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries B: Unsolicited Manuscripts</span> contains unsolicited manuscripts sent to Semiotext(e). They have been identified as unsolicited by the use of a form letter and/or the inclusion of an SASE. Materials are arranged alphabetically by the name of the sender. Multiple submissions are arranged chronologically. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES IV: Subject Files</span> brings together the subject files kept by Lotringer on various topics, artists, theorists and regions. The subject files contain various documents types, sometimes containing notes, photocopies, clippings, correspondence, manuscripts and/or photographs. They are arranged alphabetically by folder title. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES V: Sylvère Lotringer Projects</span> assembles the body of Lotringer's work that is not directly related to the Semiotext(e) group. It contains subseries for his writing (including his book on sex offenders, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Overexposed</span>); his film projects, often in collaboration with his then-wife Chris Kraus; conferences, events and tours that he organized or participated in as an individual; academic papers, personal papers, and a subseries of notes and fragments. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries A: Writing</span> contains drafts, proofs and notes pertaining to writing projects that Lotringer worked on which do not appear under the Semiotext(e) name. Materials are arranged alphabetically by project title; where alternate titles are known they are indicated in parentheses. Within a project, materials are arranged alphabetically. </p><p> In <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries B: Film</span> materials are arranged alphabetically by film title and include scripts, notes, shooting schedules, promotional materials, etc. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries C: Conference, Events and Tours</span> contains materials pertaining to conferences and events that Lotringer participated in or organized outside the activities of the Semiotext(e) group. The series also includes materials pertaining to lecture tours and research trips. Materials are arranged alphabetically by conference, event or tour name. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries D: Academic Work</span> contains course materials, student bibliographies, and information on Sylvere's career at specific academic institutions. Materials are arranged alphabetically by folder name. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries E: Journals, Datebooks, and Biographical Papers</span> consists of Lotringer's journals, datebooks, and copies of his curriculum vitae. Materials are arranged alphabetically by folder title. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries F: Notes and Fragments</span> assembles handwritten notes, lists, and fragments of text that could not be linked to a larger project. The series begins with two sets of fiches that were filed in wooden boxes. These materials date from early in Lotringer's career and they have been retained in their original order. Subsequent materials are arranged alphabetically by topic or title when available. Unidentified materials can be found at the end. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES VI: Photographic Materials</span> contains only photographic material that could not be linked to a larger project, or was not contained with manuscripts, subject files, or correspondence elsewhere in the archive. The series is comprised mostly of prints, but also slides, contact sheets and negatives. </p><p> In <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries A: Professional</span> all photographic materials are arranged alphabetically by the photographer's name. When available, the subject's name appears in parentheses. Photos taken by unknown photographers can be found at the end of the series. </p><p> In <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries B: Personal</span> photographic prints are arranged alphabetically by the subject's name, with unknown subjects appearing at the end. Negatives are arranged chronologically at the end of the series. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES VII: Financial Papers</span> includes files of order forms, tax returns, invoices and receipts. Material is described at the box level. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES VIII: Clippings and Photocopies</span> contains folders of photocopies and clippings that were not labelled and could not be linked to a project elsewhere in the archive. Materials are arranged alphabetically by author's name. All miscellaneous folders are arranged chronologically at the end of the series. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">
SERIES IX: Editions of Publications</span> contains copies of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span> Issues (<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries A</span>), Foreign and Native Agents series books (<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries B</span>), Sylvère Lotringer's publications (<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries C</span>), and foreign translations of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span> and Lotringer's books (<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries D</span>). The books are arranged chronologically. In the case of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span> books in the first two subseries, preference has been given to including those books in the Downtown Collection if Fales did not already have a copy on the shelf. For issues of Semiotext(e) not found in this series, please check the Fales holdings in the Downtown collection: P99.S38. Books from the Foreign and Native Agents series can be found by searching by author or title in Bobcat. </p><p> For <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES X: Video</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES XI: Audio</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES XII: Film
