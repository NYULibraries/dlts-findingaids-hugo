    <p>The Kemstedt-Waller Family Papers consist of a handwritten recipe notebook, written by Frederick Herman Kemstedt, who immigrated from Germany to Baltimore, Maryland around 1912. He worked for many years as a baker for a family-run business, Ervin's Bakery, on North Charles Street. He was known to use only fresh ingredients and refused to use artificial food-color dyes, making his own from fruit extracts.

Kemstedt's grandson, James Waller, is the author of the Drinkology book series, the first published in 2003: <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology: The Art and Science of the Cocktail,</span> was wildly popular, with a first and second edition published and a revised edition in 2010. He also published <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology Wine: A Guide to the Grape</span> (2005), <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology EATS: A Guide to Bar Food and Cocktail Party Fair</span> (with Romona Ponce, 2006), and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology Beer: A Book About the Brew </span> (2011).

  <div>
      <p> Frederick Herman Kemstedt was born on November 4, 1895 in Hannover, Germany. He became a cabin boy on a freighter when he was sixteen and left ship during a voyage to New York. He offically immigrated in 1912 and made his way to Baltimore, Maryland by working in various bakeries. He became a baker by trade and was known for his artistic cake decorating. He worked for many years at Ervin's Bakery on North Charles Street in Baltimore. He was known to use only fresh ingredients and refused to use artificial food-color dyes, but made his own from fruits. When the owners of Ervin's passed away, the younger generation sold and closed the bakery. Kemstedt then worked at the Hochschold Kohn Department Store's bakery in downtown Baltimore. He developed health issues and died at the age of sixty-one in 1956. </p><p> Kemstedt's grandson, James Waller, is the author of the Drinkology book series, the first published in 2003: <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology: The Art and Science of the Cocktail,</span> which was wildly popular with a first and second edition published, and revised in 2010. He also published <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology Wine: A Guide to the Grape</span> (2005), <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology EATS: A Guide to Bar Food and Cocktail Party Fair</span> (with Romona Ponce, 2006), and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Drinkology Beer: A Book About the Brew </span> (2011). Waller has also been a featured presenter at various related events, including several Tales of the Cocktail festivals in New Orleans. </p><p> A biographic narrative on Frederick Herman Kemstedt was written by his daughter, Dorothy Marie Lena Kemstedt, December 2009. The above biography was taken from that narrative. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The Kemstedt-Waller Family Papers consist of a handwritten recipe notebook from baker Frederick Herman Kemstedt with personal notes and photographs laid in, as well as papers from his grandson, author James Waller. Herman Kemstedt's handwritten recipe book documents not only his baking practices, but also stands as an example of a manuscript cookbook and the ways in which cooking and baking methods intersect with economics, immigration patterns, and family histories. Waller's material contains files related to his series of Drinkology books, including publicity, appearances, and clippings. A small selection of restaurant menus and play/event programs collected by Waller, are also in this collection. </p>
