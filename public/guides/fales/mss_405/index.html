    <div class="abstract "><h3 class="label formattednote-header">Abstract</h3>
    <p>Larry Polansky (b. 1954) is an American music composer, performer, teacher, writer, and computer programmer. The Larry Polansky Papers document an individual's ongoing career in the creation, performance, and education of music, beginning in the 1970s to the mid-2010s. The bulk of these papers consist of Polansky's extensive output as a composer through work files, performance notes, and sound recordings. Event ephemera and audiovisual recordings document musical performances and festival/conference appearances from the 1980s through the mid-2010s. This collection contains office files for Frog Peak Music, an artists' collective co-founded by Polansky and Jody Diamond, as well as administrative files for Lingua Press, a company absorbed by Frog Peak Music in 1995. Polansky's departmental files from Mills College and Dartmouth College dating from the 1980s through 2013 can also be found in this collection. Writing and project files in both paper and electronic format document Polansky's extensive and varied interests within the modern music field, covering subjects such as music composition, psychoacoustics and formal perception, new tuning systems, instrumentation, and computer programs for algorithmic composition. Of note are his work files on his profiles and analysis of various composers and their works including Johanna Magdalena Beyer, Ruth Crawford Seeger, and James Tenney. Polansky's personal files contain correspondence and subject files related to his work, illustrating his extensive network of colleagues and friends within his field. Large groupings of regularly backed up computer files containing a combination of personal and professional documents from the 1980s to the 2010s are in this collection.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> Larry Polansky is a composer, performer, teacher, editor, and writer. Polansky taught at the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music from 1980-1990, where he also co-authored with Phil Burk and David Rosenboom the computer music language Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL).

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection documents Larry Polansky's ongoing work in the contemporary music field from the 1970s to the mid-2010s through music compositions, recordings, teaching notes, business and project files, as well as concert ephemera in paper and electronic formats. Business files in this collection were generated by Polansky's artists' collective, Frog Peak Music, and contain promotional catalogs, publicity material, as well as client files which provide insight into the operation of a collective devoted to publishing and producing experimental and unique works by composers active during the 1980s into the 2000s. Office files for Lingua Press contain administrative material, as well as documentation of the company's 1995 acquisition by Frog Peak Music. Polansky's extensive writings on modern music theory, composers, and compositions are represented in this collection through paper and electronic versions of notes and edited drafts of articles, papers, and reviews written throughout the 1970s to the 2000s. Paper and electronic files, as well as audio recordings document Polansky's various projects, including his music recording career, development of his computer program Hierarchical Music Specification Language (HMSL), and his project with Indonesian composers and performers from the 1980s with Jody Diamond. Lectures notes and slides, correspondence, and faculty-related material in this collection relate to Polansky's music composition and theory classes he taught at Mills College Center for Contemporary Music from the 1980s to 1990s, and Dartmouth College from 1990 to 2013. This collection also contains his archived website; his backed up personal and professional electronic files; news clippings; correspondence and subject files; and his private audiocassette collection can also be found in this collection. </p>

  <div>
      <p> Boxes were transferred from the donor to the Fales Library and Special Collections in 2014, along with a box-level container list written by a donor associate. Documentation supporting the container list indicated the boxes were not in any particular order. Upon arrival at the library, staff transferred box contents to standard size record cartons and oversize boxes for appropriate onsite storage. This reboxing altered the original box numbering and content descriptions as some boxes were combined, or separated. A new spreadsheet was created with updated box numbers, while notating in a separate field the original box content descriptions and old box numbers from the donor's inventory. </p><p> Before processing, an initial survey was completed, confirming the material did not have any logical original order, with the exception of small groups of alphabetical correspondence/subject folders removed from file cabinets as well as Frog Peak/Linqua Press office files. The majority of the material had been placed loose in cartons, sometimes grouped by format (e.g. audio reels, cassette tapes, selected sheet music).  </p><p> Material in this collection naturally fell into rough groupings such as compositions/arrangements, teaching files, writings, performance ephemera, Frog Peak/Lingua Press files, and personal material.  </p><p> When possible, original file folders were retained. If it was necessary to replace the folder, the original file titles were transcribed onto the new acid-free folders in brackets. Loose material was grouped and placed in acid-free folders and boxes, with archivist-designated titles. </p><p> Audiovisual material was grouped by format and listed at the box level within appropriate series. </p><p> 144 carriers of born-digital material were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.  </p><p> Larry Polansky's website was archived to the Internet Archive using the Archive-It service beginning in 2015 and site crawls are as of 2019 being accrued semiannually. </p>
