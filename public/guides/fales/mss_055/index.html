It contains more than three hundred items relating to the early history of New York State, with a particular focus on the American Revolutionary War. <br></p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Richard Maass was an alumnus of New York University, having graduated from the School of Commerce (now the Stern School) in 1949 with a degree in economics. Maass was active in the political and educational affairs of the county; he was appointed as mayor of White Plains in 1974, and held the office of Westchester County Historian from 1974 to 1981. Maass served his community as the President of the Purchase College Council, and was a member of the American Jewish Committee and the Westchester County Historical Society. Along with his father-in-law, Richard M. Lederer, who served for many years as the Village Historian for Scarsdale, Maass was involved with the Manuscript Society from its earliest inception, and served as president of the organization from 1954-1956. In addition to the collecting interests represented by the Richard Maass Collection of Westchester and New York State, Maass assembled notable collections of Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Paine materials, as well as a significant collection of books relating to pirates. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Richard Maass Collection of Westchester and New York State consists of over three hundred autograph letters, documents, and newspapers which chronicle the early history of New York State from its colonization by the Dutch to the mid-nineteenth century. The collection is, however, particularly rich in materials relating to the Revolutionary War and can provide researchers with multiple perspectives on significant events and individual military campaigns. For example, the Battle of White Plains is amply documented in the collection through correspondence from participants and observers, as well as in contemporary newspaper accounts. </p><p> The arrangement of the collection largely reflects Maass's own organization. Each manuscript, with a few exceptions, has been listed and described in the finding aid. For many of the items the collection also holds additional information provided by Maass regarding specific documents. These have been retained and, in Series I, II, III, IV, and VI, filed in folders designated with the letter "A" following the documents they describe. These folders are not listed in the finding but share the same number; for instance if one wishes to consult Maass' information regarding the materials in Series IA Box 1 Folder 1 one should request Series IA Box 1 Folder 1A. Almost every folder for each item in the collection contained a one to two page description of the document, as well as other ancillary materials such as transcriptions and/or translations of documents by Maass. These folders also occasionally contained provenance information and transcripts. Any additions to the collection will be processed as separate accretions. </p><p> In addition to autograph letters and historical documents, the Maass Collection contained a small amount of printed materials. These chiefly consisted of over thirty different early American, British, and French newspapers, dating mainly from the eighteenth century. These items have been organized as a separate series (Series V). </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES DESCRIPTION:</span>  </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I: New York State</span>  </p><p> Series I contains documents pertaining to the history of New York State, exclusive of Westchester County, with a particular emphasis on New York City. It is arranged chronologically. </p><p> Subseries A contains two legal boxes of letters and documents dating from the early settlement of New York by the Dutch through the late eighteenth century. These documents range from records of everyday life in both the Dutch and British colonies to contemporary descriptions of significant historical and political events affecting the colonies and the new state. This subseries also contains numerous documents relating to the Revolutionary War in New York State, including an eyewitness account of the British invasion of New York City in 1776 by Mrs. A. Hampton. </p><p> Subseries B is the James Alexander Collection. It contains eight letters to and from Alexander (1691-1756) and his wife, Mary, housed in one small legal box. Alexander was surveyor-general of New York and New Jersey, an attorney, and a contributor to the New York Weekly Journal. In 1735 he was disbarred because he served as counsel for Journal editor Peter Zenger in the famous freedom-of-the-press case. Alexander also was a co-founder of the American Philosophical Society. The James Alexander Collection was purchased as a group by Mr. Maass. </p><p> Subseries C contains oversize material, mainly consisting of deeds and other records of land grants in New York City and State. It is housed in two flat boxes. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II. Westchester</span>  </p><p> Series II contains documents pertaining to the early history of what is present day Westchester County. It is arranged chronologically. </p><p> Subseries A contains a wide range of letters and other documents dating from the late seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century, but the bulk of the material in this subseries dates from the Revolutionary War period. Included within the four legal boxes of this subseries are numerous receipts, orderly and pay books, and correspondence from military officers, including ten documents or letters from George Washington. </p><p> Subseries B contains oversize material, mainly consisting of deeds and other records of land grants inWestchester. These are housed in a flat box, with the exception of one item which is kept in the map case. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series III: Mayors and Governors Autographs</span>  </p><p> Series III contains correspondence and other documents signed by mayors of New York City and Governors of New York State (and New Jersey). It is arranged chronologically. </p><p> Subseries A contains materials which represent the broadest range of dates in the collection. It begins with a document signed by the first Van Cortlandt, Oloff Stevenson, a burgomaster of New Amsterdam, and concludes with a check signed by William Gaynor, an early twentieth century mayor of New York City. The selection of governors is equally diverse, and includes two documents signed by the notorious Lord Cornbury (Edward Hyde) as well as the extremely rare autograph of George Clarke. </p><p> Subseries B contains oversize material signed by various mayors or governors. It is housed in a flat box, with the exception of one item which is kept in the map case. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series IV: Other Historical Letters and Manuscripts</span>  </p><p> Series IV contains documents which do not relate directly to the history of New York State. It contains only three items in one small legal box, but among these are included a Massachusetts resolution signed by Samuel Warren, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock, and an important letter from John Quincy Adams regarding the abolition of slavery. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series V: Printed Materials</span>  </p><p> Series V contains printed materials and Mr. Maass' notes relating to these items. The newspapers are divided by size into two groups, each of which is organized alphabetically by title. </p><p> Subseries A contains one legal box and two flat boxes of newspapers. Small-sized newspapers are arranged in alphabetical order in the legal box. A second alphabetical arrangement of larger-sized newspapers are housed in two flat boxes. Folders 55 through 62 contain manuscripts that were not assigned folder numbers during the original processing of the collection.  </p><p> Subseries B contains three archival storage boxes, numbered 17, 18, and 19, holding research notes and transcriptions or translations of the various articles made by Mr. Maass. They have been sorted into separate folders which are arranged alphabetically and then chronologically. This subseries is not enumerated in the container list. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series VI: Accretions</span>  </p><p> Subseries A contains letters to and from General Charles Lee. </p><p> Subseries B contains letters by and about Benedict Arnold and is especially rich in eyewitness accounts of the events and trials surrounding his failed collaboration with the British in 1781. </p>
