    <p>Sean O'Casey (1880-1964) was an Irish playwright and memoirist noted for his portrayal of the lives of Ireland's working class and poor.  O'Casey is assoicated with Dublin's Abbey Theatre, and his significant plays include "The Shadow of a Gunman", "Juno and the Paycock", "The Plough and the Stars", "Cock-A-Doodle Dandy", and "The Bishop's Bonfire".  Casey also produced a six-volume autobiography.  This collection consists of letters written by O'Casey to David H. Greene, a leading scholar of Irish literature.

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note </h3>
  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Sean O'Casey (1880-1964)</span> was an Irish playwright and memoirist noted for his portrayal of the lives of Ireland's working class and poor.  O'Casey was born in Dublin in 1880 and struggled in his early life with poverty and illness. He became involved in the Irish nationalist movement, was noted for his socialist and communist political beliefs, and was often critical of the Catholic Church.  O'Casey's first significant success as a dramatist came with the acceptance and production of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Shadow of a Gunman</span> by the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1923.  The Abbey Theatre would produce several of his subsequent plays, including <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Juno and the Paycock</span>, and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Plough and the Stars</span>, which caused riots after being criticized as anti-Irish.  In 1926, O'Casey went to London on what was intended to be a short visit, but decided to remain in England as a result of disputes with the Abbey Theatre and several figures in the Irish literary community.  He continued to write and produced several other notable dramatic works, including <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Purple Dust</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Red Roses for Me</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Cock-A-Doodle Dandy</span>, and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Bishop's Bonfire</span>.  O'Casey also produced an autobiography that was released in six individual volumes from 1939 to 1954.  Sean O'Casey is  regarded as one of the leading Irish playwrights of the 20th Century. (1) <br><br> </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">David H. Greene (1913-2008)</span>, was a leading scholar of Irish literature and professor at New York University.  Greene edited <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">1000 years of Irish Prose</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">An Anthology of Irish Literature</span>, and co-edited <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Matter with Ireland</span>, a collection of writings from George Bernard Shaw.  He also co-wrote the authorized biography of Irish dramatist John M. Synge, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">J.M. Synge, 1871-1909</span>.  O'Casey and Greene met in the 1930s while Greene was a graduate student at Harvard University, and continued a friendship and correspondence until O'Casey's death in 1964.
