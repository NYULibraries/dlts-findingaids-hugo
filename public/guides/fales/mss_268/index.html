  <div>
      <p> Johnny Science (b. January 13, 1955) was a musician, make-up artist, and LGBT community leader. Born Susan Elaine Greengras, she first began experimenting with theatrical make-up as a child in Englewood, New Jersey. 
During 1977 - 1980, Susan studied psychology at Fairleigh Dickensen University and began specializing in gender and transsexuality.  </p><p> She first began to adopt the surname "Science" while leading a band of the same name and art directing at New York nightclub Max's Kansas City in 1980. It was also during this time that Susan began to advocate for lesbian S&M by occasionally performing with leather implements. After passing as a man during these performances, Susan began making serious inquiries about surgical transition and began taking testosterone.  </p><p> As a man he answered to a few different names: Johnny Armstrong, Daniel Austen, and John Grant. Johnny became a special effects make-up apprentice and began networking with the "Female-to-Male" community in 1984. In 1987, he was a facilitator and guest speaker at the International Foundation for Gender Education Annual Symposium in Massachusetts, provided "male make-over" techniques, led a discussion of "passing" strategies, and began doing make-up for performance artist Diane Torr. In 1989, Johnny founded the F2M Fraternity and produced its newsletter <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Rites of Passage</span>. Between 1991 - 1992, Johnny founded The Drag King Club, began to coordinate "Drag-King-for-a-Day" workshops, and collaborated with artist Annie Sprinkle to produce her film "Linda/Les & Annie: A Transexual Love Story." Johnny continued to provide make-up services and represent this community in mainstream media by appearing on the Howard Stern Show, the Phil Donohue Show, and the Joan Rivers Show, to name a few. In 1993, Johnny began producing and hosting a weekly television show for the Manhattan Public Access Television Station called "That Show with Johnny Science / The Drag King Club."  </p><p> Johnny's desire to pass as a gay male led him to evolve from the lesbian S&M community to the male S&M underground. In the late 1990s he was a member of the Gay Male S&M Activists (GMSMA) and president of the Metro NY Chapter of the National Leather Association. He founded The Jovian Gentlemen, a gay male social group that connected younger and elder males. He passed away in 2007.  </p>
