      <p> Robert Hammond (b. 1920) was Professor Emeritus of French Literature and Cinema at SUNY-Cortland. He earned a BA from the University of Rochester (1942), and both an MA (1947) and PhD (1952) from Yale University. He was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to France (1949-1950) along with numerous other honors, fellowships and grants. Hammond was an instructor, and then professor of French at the University of Arizona-Tuscon (1953-1967). He later was professor of French at Harvard University (1965-1966), and a visiting professor of French Literature and Cinema at Wells College in Aurora, NY (1967-1968). After 1968 Hammond taught at SUNY-Cortland, where he also served as chair of the International Communications and Culture Department.  </p><p> Along with being a dedicated instructor, Hammond published numerous analyses and critiques of French literature and films, translated texts between French and English, and contributed countless papers and general scholarship on the French cinema. Much of Hammond's extensive scholarly work focused on French filmmaker Jean Cocteau, and his bilingual edition of Cocteau's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Beauty and the Beast</span> (NYU Press, 1970) is widely cited within the academy. Hammond wrote over 40 plays in both English and French and various other works of both poetry and prose. Hammond died in May 2009 in Paris, France. </p>
