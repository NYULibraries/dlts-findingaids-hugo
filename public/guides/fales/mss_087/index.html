    <p>Francis Timothy Dlugos was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on August 5, 1950. From 1968-1971, he was a Christian Brother at La Salle College in Philadelphia. Upon leaving the Brothers, he emerged to embrace a politically active and gay lifestyle. In Washington, D.C. Dlugos worked on Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and become heavily involved with the Mass Transit poetry scene. Dlugos then moved to New York in the late seventies where he edited and contributed to such magazines as Christopher Street, New York Native, and The Poetry Project Newsletter. He immersed himself in the downtown scene of the late-nineteen-seventies through the eighties, and became involved with fundraising projects for that scene. Sometime after being diagnosed HIV positive, Tim decided to abandon these endeavors to become a priest in the Episcopalian church. While studying at the Yale School of Divinity, Dlugos died of AIDS related complications on December 3, 1990. The collection chronicles the life of Tim Dlugos from his early development as a poet through his posthumously published books and poems.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note:</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Born in <span class="ead-geogname">Springfield, Massachusetts</span>on August 5, 1950, Francis Timothy Dlugos later grew up in <span class="ead-geogname">Arlington, Virginia</span>. He joined the Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious order, in 1968 and entered their college, <span class="ead-corpname">La Salle</span>, in <span class="ead-geogname">Philadelphia</span>. He left the Brothers a few years later in 1971 to openly embrace a politically active, gay lifestyle. He eventually left La Salle before graduating. In <span class="ead-geogname">Washington, D.C.</span>Dlugos worked on <span class="ead-name">Ralph Nader</span>'s Public Citizen and become heavily involved with the <span class="ead-name">Mass Transit poetry</span>scene. Describing his poetry in None of the Above, an early anthology in which Dlugos appeared, he stated: "1. I try to write out of the time & space I find myself in. 2. My best work takes the 'timeless' -- spontaneous goofs, flights, body motions -- & drags it onto timeline, the 'real world' where most of us live. I am 'successful' when the language (clean combination of words) takes me or someone else back to the original combination of feelings & perceptions 'out there,' or somewhere equally nice. 3. My work is part of the nostalgia craze; all of it reminds me of where I used to be. 4. Grace, in a very orthodox sense, is my major preoccupation." Dlugos moved to New York in the late seventies where he edited and contributed to such magazines as <span class="ead-corpname">Christopher Street</span>, <span class="ead-corpname">New York Native</span>, and <span class="ead-corpname">The Poetry Project Newsletter</span>. He read everywhere and with almost everyone involved the downtown scene. Whether writing about pop culture, <span class="ead-geogname">New York</span>, being gay, alcoholism, or <span class="ead-name">AIDS</span>, content always came secondary to style in Dlugos' poetry. Sometime after being diagnosed <span class="ead-name">HIV</span>positive, Dlugos decided to abandon his career as a fundraiser to become a priest in the Episcopalian church where he could utilize and express his experiences as a gay man. While studying at the <span class="ead-corpname">Yale School of Divinity</span>, Dlugos died of AIDS related complications on December 3, 1990. </p><p> Bibliography: Works by Tim Dlugos: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">Coming Attractions.

      <p> The Tim Dlugos Papers are a part of the <span class="ead-name">Downtown Collection</span>at the Fales Library, New York University. The Fales Library is the primary special collections division of the NYU libraries, housing over 160,000 volumes of English and American literature from 1700 to the present. Strengths of the collection include the development of the English and American novel, with an emphasis on the Gothic and the Victorian novel. The Downtown Collection, of which the Dlugos Papers are a part, is a comprehensive collection of printed materials, archives, and other materials related to the Downtown New York scene from ca. 1975 to the present. </p><p> The collection includes Dlugos' books, chapbooks, correspondence, poetry, prose, periodical contributions, manuscripts (his and other writers), diaries, journals, video and audio recordings, notes on course work, and a host of biographical and miscellaneous material. The collection chronicles the life of Tim Dlugos from his early development as a <span class="ead-occupation">poet</span>through his posthumously published books and poems. <span class="ead-name">David Trinidad</span>, a long-time friend and fellow poet, aided in the processing of the collection by sorting most of the poetry manuscripts chronologically. Printed materials were removed and catalogued in the Downtown Collection and are listed in Bobcat. </p><p> The archival portion of the Tim Dlugos Collection is the Tim Dlugos Papers. It comprises his personal correspondence with both New York and Washington writers, manuscripts, periodical contributions, reviews, interviews, fundraising projects, course work from his undergraduate years and Yale Divinity School, and other assorted biographical material. The Tim Dlugos Papers chronicle the wide range of events and the driving forces of his life.
