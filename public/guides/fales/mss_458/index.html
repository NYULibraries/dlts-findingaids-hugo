    <p>The David Gurin Collection on Jack Smith contains materials about or created by New York-based actor, experimental filmmaker, photographer, and performance artist Jack Smith (1932-1989). These materials were assembled by his friend David Gurin in the early 1960s and following his death in 1989. Materials include correspondence, clippings, promotional ephemera, and photographs. The collection is of particular importance to researchers interested in the development of Smith's most notable film <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Flaming Creatures</span>.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> David Gurin was a friend of New York-based actor, experimental filmmaker, photographer, and performance artist Jack Smith (1932-1989) and was one of the uncredited participants in Smith's most acclaimed film <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Flaming Creatures</span>. Gurin met Smith through his friend Irving Rosenthal, a writer associated with the Beat Generation, and spent much of the spring and summer of 1961 wandering around Manhattan with Smith -- going to movies on 42nd Street, visiting Gurin's mother in Brooklyn, and relaxing in Tompkins Square Park -- before leaving for graduate studies at Harvard University. Afterwards, Gurin saw Smith during school holidays and participated in some of his projects. In late 1961 or early 1962 Gurin posed for photographs with Marian Zazeela in Smith's Lower East Side apartment. During the summer of 1962, Gurin spent time on the roof of the Windsor Theatre during the filming of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Flaming Creatures</span>, either helping Smith set up scenes or acting as a member of the chorus while costumed in drag. The two remained friends as Smith moved to several other apartments in the city, including his loft in Soho. He even accompanied Smith during a meeting with Isabel and Fred Eberstadt, Park Avenue residents who were benefactors of Smith's art and providers of his loft. Since Gurin was working as a city planner at the time, the two once contemplated working on a film about New York City, a project that Smith referred to as No City, but the film was ultimately never realized. </p>

  <div>
      <p> The David Gurin Collection on Jack Smith contains materials about or created by New York-based actor, experimental filmmaker, photographer, and performance artist Jack Smith (1932-1989). These materials were assembled by his friend David Gurin in the early 1960s and following the artist's death in 1989. The collection more specifically contains some of Smith's handwritten letters to Gurin from the early 1960s; one of Smith's business cards; gallery announcements, newspaper clippings, and fliers advertising some of Smith's films and art performances in the 1960s and 1970s; staged photographs that pre-date the conclusion of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Flaming Creatures</span>; as well as a slide Smith took during a trip to Rio de Janeiro in the mid-1960s. The collection also includes clippings about Smith's death and an invitation to the artist's memorial. </p>
