      <p> Pat Ivers attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts before working at Manhattan Cable TV's Public Access Department. She began documenting New York City's downtown nightclub scene in the 1970s, working with Nam Juin Paik and other video artists, as well as the Metropolis Video collective and Emily Armstrong. In the 1980s Ivers was instrumental in the creation of the Corporate and Cable Communications Program (now The Media Arts and Technology Department) at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) of The City University of New York (CUNY). She began working for ABC Sports in the 1990s and is currently a Producer/Editor at WPIX. </p><p> Emily Armstrong scheduled, produced, and promoted television programs as a coordinator in Manhattan Cable TV's Public Access Department in the 1970s. Together with Pat Ivers, a fellow MCTV employee, Armstrong began documenting New York City's downtown nightclub scene to present on the weekly cable television show NIGHTCLUBBING. Armstrong designed and ran the Professional Video Training Program (PROVIT), which retrained thousands of NYC trade union media professionals in new digital technologies. She also worked as a New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) Video Artist-In-Residence in the public school system. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Sources:</span> </p><p> Go Nightclubbing (www.gonightclubbing.com/index.html) </p>

  <div>
      <p> This arrangement retains the collection's original order. Titles of the videos derive from the titles provided by Ivers and Armstrong. The videos are arranged chronologically, then alphabetically, in the following series: </p><p> Series I: Performances </p><p> Series I contains live performances recorded by Ivers and Armstrong for the weekly cable television show NIGHTCLUBBING. The footage captures various artists and musicians performing in nightclubs around New York City between 1976 and 1980. This series also includes undated recordings as well as later recordings from 1997 and 2003. </p><p> Series II: Interviews </p><p> Series II contains video interviews with various musicians, performance artists, critics, and writers involved in the New York City punk scene. Many of the videos are undated. The dated interviews were all made in the 2000s except for one recording from 1977. </p><p> Series III: The Come-On's </p><p> The seven videos in Series III comprise two shoots and rough edits of The Come-On's video installation project. The project allowed participants to select to view a tape of a performer, or "seducer," in a photo booth. Each tape featured a musician or artist from the downtown scene who attempted to "seduce" the viewer.  </p><p> Series IV: Narrative Tapes </p><p> The six videos in Series IV comprise narrative tapes, which functioned as the precursor to modern music videos. In each narrative tape, an artist's performance is accompanied by thematically relevant stories, images, and video clips.  </p><p> Series V: Video Lounge </p><p> The nineteen videos in Series V contain Video Lounge footage captured by Ivers and Armstrong. The artists created the Video Lounge format after being commissioned to design a video installation for the opening of the Danceteria nightclub in 1980. Video Lounge became a permanent feature at Danceteria but Ivers and Armstrong also included the format in the NIGHTCLUBBING television series, which showed video art, various video clips and footage, and musical performances. </p><p> Series VI: Nightclubbing </p><p> The sixteen videos in Series VI contain episodes of the NIGHTCLUBBING television series that was broadcast as a local television show in New York City and was also screened at late night viewings at the Anthology Film Archives. While the majority of these recordings are undated, the dated videos were made during 1975-1980. </p>
