Hosted by Andy Humm since 1985, Ann Northrop joined as co-host in 1996. The program covers LGBT current events and issues, often including interviews and special events.

  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gay USA</span> is a weekly news program dedicated to LGBT current events, history and issues facing the community both domestically and internationally. Founded in the early 1980's by gay activist and video producer Lou Maletta, who also founded the Gay Cable Network (GCN) in 1982. Hosted by Andy Humm since 1985, Ann Northrop joined as co-host in 1996. Created to counter the poor mainstream reporting on LGBT issues, specifically the AIDS epidemic, the program provides in depth analytical reporting and interviews rooted in LGBT activism and history. <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gay USA</span> covered both the Democratic and Republican Conventions from 1984 to 2000, as well as the demonstrations occurring across the country surrounding LGBT and AIDS issues. The show originally aired on GCN before moving to the Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN) in 2001, and is distributed nationally by Free Speech TV. It is also available online via Free Speech TV's youtube channel. </p><p> Andy Humm began his career in journalism in the 1970's and began hosting <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gay USA</span> in 1985. In addition to his work as co-anchor, he has hosted a variety of other programs, including <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Informed Sources</span> (1991-1995), a weekly public affairs roundtable, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Self-Help</span> (1979-84), a weekly interview with leaders of mutual aid groups on WBAI-FM radio, segments of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Live Wire</span> and<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic"> Thirteen Live</span> public affairs programs in 1991, and the national PBS special, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Out in America</span>. In print journalism, Humm has written for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York City News, Gay City News, the Village Voice, POZ</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Next</span> Magazines. Humm holds a Masters in Public Health and teaches at Hunter College's School of Urban Health where he was named a Distinguished Alumnus in 2001. He was also Director of Education at the Hetrick-Martin Institute for Lesbian and Gay Youth from 1986-95.  </p><p> Ann Northrop joined <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gay USA</span> in 1996, but has worked in television since the 1970's. She did work as a freelance production assistant, wrote criticism for a nationally syndicated column, as well as writing for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Ms.</span> Magazine and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Ladies' Home Journal. </span>In 1981, Northrop joined ABC's "Good Morning America" as a writer-producer and was then recruited by George Merlis to join him at CBS News as a producer. After five years with CBS, she left and accepted a job as an AIDS educator and educator on homosexuality at New York's Hetrick-Martin Institute for Lesbian and Gay Youth. Working as an AIDS educator reconnected her with her early activist roots with the anti-war effort in the 1960s and 70s as well as with the LGBT community in New York City. After four years at the Hetrick-Martin Institute, she left to pursue other activist and advocate work on behalf of LGBT issues. Her arrival at <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gay USA</span> was her return to television. </p>
