    <p>The Annina Nosei Gallery was a New York City art gallery from 1981 to 2005. The Annina Nosei Gallery Archive comprises the records produced and used by the gallery; it also includes records of Annina Nosei's private acquisitions and sales, as well as her work as a curator/dealer before and after the Annina Nosei Gallery.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical / Historical</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Based in SoHo for fifteen years, Annina Nosei Gallery moved to Chelsea in 1995, closing in 2005. The gallery was instrumental in introducing the work of Neo Expressionist Italian and German figurative painters, as well as young American painters, to a market largely dominated by minimalism and conceptual art. From its inception until its closing in 2005, the Annina Nosei Gallery continued to promote young, emerging artists.
<br><br>
Annina Nosei was born in Rome, Italy. She received doctorates in literature and philosophy from the University of Rome, where she studied under the art historian Giulian Carlo Argan and wrote her thesis on Marcel Duchamp.  She received a Fulbright in 1964 to study in the United States, where she taught at the University of Michigan and later at UCLA, St. John's University in Manhattan, and Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn.
<br><br>
While teaching at UCLA in 1965, Nosei met the art dealer John Weber, to whom she was married from 1966 to 1973. Her first gallery experience was in helping to organize and install exhibitions at Weber's gallery in Los Angeles. In 1979, Nosei began to show and deal art in a loft owned by Larry Gagosian at 421 West Broadway, New York City, across the street from the Leo Castelli Gallery. In 1980, Nosei opened her own gallery in SoHo at 100 Prince Street. In 1995, the gallery moved to 530 West 22nd Street, in Chelsea, and closed in 2005. 
<br><br>
Nosei is known for being the first dealer to represent Jean-Michel Basquiat from 1981 to about 1983, and for providing him with materials and a space to work in the basement of the gallery. Though known primarily for representing German and American Neo-Expressionists and Italian New Image painters, the Annina Nosei Gallery represented and exhibited a diverse range of artists, such as Ghada Amer,  Julio Galan, Tsibi Geva,  Graciela Hasper, Barbara Kruger, Robert Longo, Alan McCollum, Shirin Neshat, and Jenny Watson.

  <div>
      <p> Series were created by the archivist based on discussions with Annina Nosei and on a careful appraisal of the material. Each series reflects an explicit function of the Annina Nosei Gallery in its daily activities of taking artworks on consignment; of buying, selling, and shipping artworks; of planning and executing exhibitions in its gallery space as well as at museums, art fairs, and other galleries; and of managing, promoting, and paying represented artists. Every effort was made to retain the original order of the files. The subseries reflect the titles and organization of records by the gallery. 
<br><br>
Almost all subseries titles were originated by the gallery as it created and maintained its records (and were printed on hanging files in labeled file cabinet drawers or on labeled boxes). The following four subseries were created and named by the archivist in an effort to simplify access, protect materials, and organize miscellany:  </p><p> 
<br>Series III, Subseries D
<br>Series III, Subseries E
<br>Series IV, Subseries G
<br>Series VII, Subseries C
<br><br>
<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Folders:</span> Original folders were replaced with acid-free folders. Unless in brackets, all folder titles are taken from the original folder. A folder label in brackets is a label supplied by the archivist, either because the material was not foldered or because the original folder was unlabeled. The archivist has striven to replicate the gallery's naming conventions where they could be discerned.<br> </p><p> Each folder in the archive holds the entire contents of an original folder. If there was more material in an original folder than would fit in a new folder, that material is divided between two or more folders, each folder bearing the original folder's name followed by the convention "[1/4]," "[2/4]," etc. If two different folders share the same name, each will be followed by a number in brackets denoting its position in a series/subseries (e.g., "[1]," "[2]," etc.).
<br><br>
<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Binders:</span> Unless in brackets, all binder labels are taken from the original binders. All materials separated from binders are foldered according to their original grouping in a single binder sleeve (most of which contained several items).
<br><br>
<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Photocopies:</span> All thermal paper has been replaced with a photocopied surrogate. Original folders bearing writing have been photocopied, and the photocopy has been placed at the end of the new folder. Items bearing sticky notes were photocopied, the sticky notes were removed, and the photocopies refiled with the originals (usually attached to it with a plastic clip).<br><br>
<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Dates:</span> All dates are approximate and provided by the archivist based on a cursory glance at the contents of each folder. </p>
  </div>
