  <div>
      <p> Bob Holman's varied career has been devoted to promoting poetry in American culture. Born in 1948 in Harlan, Kentucky and raised in rural Ohio, Holman attended Columbia College and graduated in 1970 with a degree in English. In 1974 Holman began his ongoing tenure as the director of the Poets Theatre in New York City and began studying with Ted Berrigan and Alice Notley at the St. Marks Poetry Project. He founded the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York City Poetry Calendar</span> in 1977 and acted as its editor until 1980. With his completion of the St. Marks curriculum in 1978 Holman joined the Project's staff, acting as a coordinator, host, and workshop leader from 1978 through 1984. In later years Holman held similar positions at several non-profit poetry groups and institutions such as the Public Theatre and the Whitney Museum, where he acted as curator for a reading series.  </p><p> During the 1970s and 1980s Holman was active as a producer/director of and/or performer in a variety of poetry festivals, tours, and other performances in New York City's Lower East Side poetry scene. From 1988 through 1989 Holman organized and hosted the "Poets in the Bars: A Celebration of the Oral Tradition" reading series sponsored by Creative Time with Pedro Pietry. He also helped to reopen the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in 1989 and worked as one of its co-directors until 1996. During his tenure Holman founded a touring company of poets, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe Live! Touring Company, in 1993 and hosted numerous Poetry Slams, a form of spoken word competition he helped to popularize. He was also active in the production and direction of plays, such as those of the "Poet's Theater Festivals" held by St. Mark's and La Mama Theatre between 1988 and 1990. His productions  during the Festivals included stagings of Tristan Tzara's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gas Heart</span>, Antonin Artaud's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Jet of Blood</span>, Vladimir Mayakovsky's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Mayakovsky: A Tragedy</span>, and Alfred Jarry's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Ubu</span>.  </p><p> Holman's first poetry video, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">sweat'n'sex'politics</span>, was introduced at The Public Theatre in 1985. The next year he began a two year tenure in the Poetry/Video Learning Project, a part of the New York City Public School system's anti-dropout efforts, designed and produced by Rise and Shine Productions. The program targeted truant high school students and offered them the opportunity to write poems and participate in the production of poetry videos with the assistance of poets. From 1987 until 1995 Holman produced and acted as the host for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic"><span class="ead-extref">Poetry Spots</span></span>, a six season broadcast of video poems on WNYC-TV which received three Emmy awards. During the 1990s Holman also produced a number of poetry television programs for PBS and MTV, including several documentaries regarding poetry in the United States. Among them are PBS' 1990 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Poet in the Third Dimension</span>, the 1991 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Words In Your Face</span> directed by Mark Pellington, the 1994 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Slammin'</span>, and MTV's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Smokin' Word</span>. One of the largest of such projects was the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">United States of Poetry</span>, a critically acclaimed five part television series co-created by Bob Holman and directed by Marc Pellington during 1996 for PBS. The program featured over sixty poets, rappers, cowboy poets, American Sign Language poets, and Slammers. The series received the 1997 International Public Television award, the San Fransisco Film Festival award, and the University of Virginia Film Festival award. In subsequent years the project completed a companion anthology, a home video release from KQED, and a soundtrack CD. Holman also [produced]a digital anthology entitled <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">World of Poetry</span> (worldofpoetry.org) and supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, describes itself as a continuation of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">United States of Poetry</span> project. </p><p> In 1995 Bob Holman, Sekou Sundiata, and Bill Adler founded Mouth Almighty/Mercury Records as the world's first major label for poetry CDs, with Holman acting as its Vice-President of Artistic Development until 1999. The label released numerous audio tracks, including works by Sekou Sundiata, Maggie Estep, Wammo, Michele Serros and Beau Sia. Some of its major releases included Allen Ginsberg's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Ballad of the Skeletons</span>, Hal Willner's compilation album <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Closed on Account of Rabies: Poems and Tales of Edgar Allan Poe</span>, and a definitive four CD William Burroughs box set, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. </p><p> Between 1993 and 1996 Holman was a Professor of Writing at The New School for Social Research, and from 1998 until 2002 a Visiting Professor of Writing and Integrated Arts at Bard College. Holman then shifted to Columbia University's School of the Arts where, as a Visiting Professor of Writing, he taught the graduate course "Exploding Text: Poetry Performance". </p><p>

The tapes contain video recordings documenting many of Bob Holman's projects between 1977 and 1994. Among them are several from the Lower East Side poetry scene in the 70s and 80s, including recordings of shows like the 1977 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Laundromat</span> and documentation of the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Poet's Theater Festivals</span> at St. Mark's and La Mama between 1988 and 1990. Performances by numerous poets are also documented, including Allen Ginsberg, Amina and Amiri Baraka, Eileen Myles, Bob Holman, Bob Rosenthal, Ed Sanders, and Ntozake Shange. Other videotapes in the series represent Holman's work for television, such as documentaries like PBS' 1991 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Words in Your Face</span> and programs like the MTV pilot for <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Smokin' Word.</span> Such tapes frequently include raw footage and outakes.

These tapes document the six seasons of "Poetry Spots," a thrice Emmy-award winning program produced by Bob Holman, and include raw footage, out-takes and finished episodes along with intersticials and half hour featured programs for the PBS archives in the form of submissions and B-rolls. Multi-generational material, such as the camera originals, edit masters, submasters, and dubs, is present for some titles.

The series consists of forty videotapes of various formats and a variety of video generations including "rough" versions, master material, dubs, and the finished series, which has already been commercially released. For many of these five episodes there are multiple "masters" and dubs. There are also "United States of Poetry" samplers from Mouth Almighty/ Mercury records. The recordings include material regarding such individuals as Czeslaw Milosz, Derek Walcott, Joseph Brodsky, Jimmy Carter, Lou Reed, Thylias Moss, Rita Dove, Michael Franti, Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Larry Eiger, Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, Carla Harryman, CD Wright, Quincy Troupe, Amir Baraka, Leonard Cohen, and Johnny Depp reading Jack Kerouac. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series IV: Mouth Almighty/ Mercury Records</span> contains thirty-seven 3/4 inch Umatic and VHS tapes.

one hundred seventy-three 3/4 inch Umatic and VHS videotapes dated between 1988 and 2001. The tapes, many of which are rare or one-of-a-kind, record both documentary footage and home made productions. Most of these were filmed in a studio but live on-site recordings are present as well. Among the performances documented by the tapes are plays by Kenneth Koch, a group reading of Jack Kerouac's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Mexico City Blues</span> at The Kitchen, and  poems by Lee Anne Brown, Reg. E. Gaines, Fanny Howe, and Anne Waldman along with performances by Bob Kaufman, Lord Buckley, Elizabet Streb, Dana Gioia, Ellyn Maybe, and Marc Smith at the Green Mill in Chicago. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series VI: Spoken Word History</span> consists of ninety-seven videotapes from between 1982 and 2001, most of which are dubs and commercial releases, documenting the recent history of spoken word and comedic performance. Included among the tapes in this series are Ron Mann's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Poetry In Motion</span>, Bill Moyers' <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Power of the Word</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Language of Life</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Voices and Visions</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">At the Forks of Troublesome: Kentucky Poets</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Best of Ernie Kovacs</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">MTV Unplugged</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">MTV Fightin' Words</span>, Wendell Berry's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Hymnody of Earth</span>, Aime Cesaire, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Poetry on ESPN X-Games</span>, and the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">1998 Taos Poetry Circus</span>. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series VII: Spoken Word Video Filmed by Bob Holman </span>consists of forty-three small format videotapes, including Video 8mm and MiniDV, dating from the years 1991-2002. The contents of the tapes reflect a range of subjects including conferences, performance series, and documentary programs featuring a variety of poets. Also present within the series is an 8mm audition tape, which includes Ani DeFranco, for the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">United States of Poetry</span> program. Other performers include Reesom Haile the poet laureate of Eritrea, poet laureate Azmir Megheeli of Yemen, Wanda Coleman, Cathy Bowman, Sekou Sundiata, Kimiko Hahn, Reg. E. Gaines, Edwin Torres, Hal Sirowitz, Elaine Equi, Patricia Smith, Nia Kuumba (an African American poetry ensemble), Todd Colby, Jessica Hagedorn, and Bob Holman himself. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series VIII: Poetry Slams</span> contains thirty-eight videotapes of various formats from 1991 to 1994. The tapes in this series document various Poetry Slam performances, including a complete video documentary, with interviews, shot by Bob Holman of the first National Poetry Slam during October 1991 in Chicago. Also present among the tapes are records reflecting the San Francisco National Poetry Slam during 1993, a Poetry Slam performance of October 1993, and the National Poetry Slam of August 1994. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series IX: Metro Home News</span> consists of eighteen twenty-minute Betacam vidoecassettes from the Metro Home News program. Very little is known about the provenance and content of these tapes, though they appear to contain raw footage. They seem to date from 1991 and among them can be found interviews with Bob Holman and Miguel Algarin, footage from Nuyorican Poet's Cafe, B Roll footage, stills of Miguel Pinero and the Lower East Side, and a show entitled "Heart of the City". </p><p> 
<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series X: Rise and Shine Productions</span> consists of sixteen VHS videotapes dating from 1985 to 1995. The tapes appear to contain a complete set of poetry videos from the Poetry/Video Learning Project, which was part of the New York City Public School system's anti-dropout program. The videotapes record performances of poems written, directed and shot, using professional equipment, by high school students. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series XI: Miscellaneous Video</span> consists of seventy-four videotapes in the form of VHS and 3/4 inch Umatic cassettes along with two reels of 16mm film. The Umatics in this series may be of unique content and possibly of superior quality. While some of the series' contents are commercially released tapes, most are believed to be dubs. Among their contents are recordings of works by poets Maggie Estep, Sekou Sundiata, Allen Ginsberg, and Bill Moyers. The two 16mm film reels are recordings of elementary education films regarding poetry and haikus. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series XII: Vinyl Sound Recordings</span> contains a substantial quantity of vinyl long play records. Their arangement reflects Bob Holman's original order. The vast majority of these are commercial releases but there is also a small number of test pressings. The series is arranged into five subseries:  </p><p> Subseries A: Vinyl Recordings - LPs 12in. and Subseries B: Vinyl Recordings EPs 7in., are composed primarily of spoken word recordings, particularly rap and poetry. They also include some rock and roll and recorded dramas. </p><p> Subseries C: Vinyl Recordings - African American consists of recordings of spoken word and musical performances from African American artists, including readings of the poetry of Imamu Amiri Baraka and Linton Kwesi Johnson and performances by The Last Poets.  </p><p> Subseries D: Vinyl Recordings - Various Poets contains spoken word performances from a variety of poets and, to a lesser extent, comedians such as Lord Buckley. </p><p> Subseries E: Vinyl Recordings - Allen Ginsberg is composed of a collection of spoken word and musical recordings previousky owned by Allen Ginsberg, which Holman purchased at a Sotheby's auction in October of 1999. </p>

The series are intended to reflect as much as possible Mr. Holman's original ordering of the materials.The exception to this rule is Series IV, Mouth Almighty/ Mercury Records, where the tapes were rearranged into groupings according to project. The vinyl sound recordings in Series XII, and Series IV, Subseries C: 2018 Accretion reflect the original order maintained by Holman. </p>
