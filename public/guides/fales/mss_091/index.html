    <p>Founded in 1978 by Stefan Eins, Fashion Moda became an important voice in the art world up until the mid-1980's. Defining itself as a 'concept,' Fashion Moda crossed postmodern boundaries and endeavored to redefine the function of art. Featuring such artists as Keith Haring, David Wojnarowicz, Jenny Holzer, Mark Kostabi, Joe Lewis, John Ahearn, and Kenny Scharf, and graffiti artists like Richard Hambleton, Koor, Crash, Daze, Spank and many others, Fashion Moda provided a venue for young artists of the period. The collection includes photographs, color slides, posters, flyers, announcements, press releases, magazine articles, reviews, grant proposals, video tapes, business files, artworks, and one audiotape.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p>  Founded in 1978 by Stefan Eins, Fashion Moda quickly became an important voice in the art world during the late 70's to mid-80's. Defining itself as a 'concept' and its South Bronx location as 'Museum of Science, Art, Invention, Technology, and Fantasy,' Fashion Moda crossed boundaries and mixed metaphors, which helped to redefine the function of art. Featuring such artists as Keith Haring, David Wojnarowicz, Jenny Holzer, Mark Kostabi, Joe Lewis, John Ahearn, Kenny Scharf and graffiti artists like Richard Hambleton, Koor, Crash, Daze, Spank and many others, Fashion Moda was a major force in establishing new venues. Its South Bronx location allowed Fashion Moda the freedom to explore the question "What is art?" and "Who defines it?" Mostly funded by grants from the NEA, NYSCA and other, outside money, the space encouraged the production of art that was not dictated by the contemporary art market or academic art training. As such, it was a center where many downtown and local South Bronx artists, writers, and performance artists first displayed their works and workshopped their ideas. It was closely tied to the global emergence of Hip Hop. Fashion Moda closed its South Bronx location in 1993. However it continues in concept. Artforum: "Fashion Moda has been around forever."  </p><p>  For a selected bibliography on Fashion Moda, see series I, box 1, folder 5.

      <p> The Fashion Moda Archive includes photographs, color slides, posters, flyers, announcements, press releases, magazine articles, reviews, grant proposals, video tapes, business files, artworks, and one audio tape.

Slides, press releases, flyers and other information about the same exhibition, event or artist may be in more than one series. Some cross referencing has been done, but it is not comprehensive.  </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES DESCRIPTION</span>  </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I: Fashion Moda Overview </span>  </p><p>  Series I contains documents which were arranged by Fashion Moda's director Stefan Eins. The original intent of this grouping was for a proposal made to the Andy Warhol Foundation, with the intent that this history would be placed online. Therefore it has been left separated from the rest of the collection. This series contains slides, photographs, posters, magazine articles, and a selected bibliography. The files are kept in the original order as received by the Fales Library.  </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II: Fashion Moda as a business.</span>  </p><p>  Series II is divided into two subseries and contains three boxes of documents.
