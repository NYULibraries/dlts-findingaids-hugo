  <div>
      <p> Chris Kraus (born 1955) is an American writer, art critic, editor, filmmaker, writing instructor, playwright, and theatre director.  She is best known for her autobiographical novel, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">I Love Dick</span>.   From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, she worked in New York City as a playwright and theatre director.  She wrote and directed the plays <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Disparate Action/Desperate Action</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Readings from the Diaries of Hugo Ball</span>, and co-wrote <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">I Talked about God with Antonin Artaud</span> with Sylvère Lotringer.  They later collaborated on the film <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">How to Shoot a Crime</span>.  Kraus was married to Lotringer from the late 1980s through the late 1990s.  While working in theatre in the early 1980s, Kraus began to write and produce short films.  These include <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Golden Bowl or Repression</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gravity and Grace</span>.  In 1990, she started as co-editor with Lotringer at <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span>, a journal and small publishing house he founded 1974, and she started the Native Agents Series there at the time.

  <div>
      <p> The Chris Kraus Papers document Kraus's career as a writer, art critic, editor, filmmaker, writing instructor, playwright, and theatre director.  The collection dates from 1975 through 2015 and contains paper, born-digital, and audiovisual materials documenting her work through this time.  These materials include drafts of Kraus's plays, films, novels, and critical writings; research materials used in her work; video, audio, and film recordings for her films; correspondence with friends and collaborators; and Kraus's personal diaries.  Well documented in the collection is her work as a writer of fiction and non-fiction, and as a filmmaker.  The collection includes her autobiographical novels <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">I Love Dick</span>, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Torpor</span>, and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Summer of Hate</span>.  Kraus's work on these novels is documented through paper and born-digital material, including diary entries regarding experiences that served as the basis for the novels, notes and drafts, research and source materials, galley proofs, publicity and reviews, and correspondence regarding all aspects of the creative process.  Similar material for her critical art writing and films is included in the collection, particularly the collections of her critical writing, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Video Green:  Los Angeles Art and the Triumph of Nothingness</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Where Art Belongs</span>; her biography <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">After Kathy Acker</span>; and her films <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Golden Bowl or Repression</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Gravity and Grace</span>.  Also included in the collection are paper and born-digital typescripts, notes, and publicity materials for her plays and theatre work, as well as video, audio, and film recordings of these performances.  Also in the collection are correspondence, drafts, and notes documenting Kraus's work as a co-editor at <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Semiotext(e)</span> and material from The Chance Event, a three day event curated by Kraus in Nevada in 1996 that focused on philosophy, music, and culture. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> During the pre-processing survey in 2016, a considerable amount of mold was found in both paper and audiovisual materials.  If mold was spread throughout an entire box of material, that entire box was quarantined.  If mold was contained to part of a box, the moldy material was separated from the non-moldy material and quarantined.  Separation sheets were created for material removed from its original location; copies were placed in the material's original location and with the separated material.  The project archivist worked with Barbara Goldsmith Preservation & Conservation Department staff to distinguish moldy items from dirty items and to return the non-moldy items to their original boxes.  Some moldy paper materials were cleaned by Preservation Department staff and others by an outside vendor.  Once cleaned and returned, the materials were returned to their original boxes by the project archivist.  As of April 2019, some audiovisual items were still in quarantine awaiting cleaning. </p><p> In 2018, select film, video, and audio materials were separated from the collection by the audiovisual archivist for rehousing and digitization.  The original items were returned once digitization was complete.  As of April 2019, some of these items were still in the Media Preservation Department awaiting rehousing and digitization. </p><p> Between March and May 2019, the collection was arranged and described by an archivist.  Series were created according to the arrangement in which the collection was received and material was arranged together intellectually within these series. Paper material for each series was brought together physically, with oversized paper materials, audiovisual material, and physical digital media housed together as appropriate. Where necessary, separation sheets were created to sustain the intellectual relationship between materials of different formats that were initially housed together.  </p><p> Paper material was housed in archival folders and boxes. Physical digital media and audiovisual material were housed in archival boxes. Preservation photocopies were created for material originally printed on thermal fax paper. </p><p> Floppy disks, hard drives, and optical media containing data files were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit.  Video DVDs were imaged and arranged on local storage.  Audio CDs were ripped to the WAV file format and arranged on local storage.  Directories were created for material arranged together intellectually in the collection. </p><p> 
New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. </p>
