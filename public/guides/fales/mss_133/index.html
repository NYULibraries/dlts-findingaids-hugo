    <p>Beginning in 1970 Mabou Mines helped revolutionize experimental theatre in the United States and contributed to an international movement in avant-garde, postmodern theatre. The Mabou Mines create multi-media performances utilizing both existing texts and building performances utilizing a pastiche style that draws on a variety of sources. The materials in the collection document this creative process and the administrative functions necessary to maintain and promote the company.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Mabou Mines</span> is a collaborative, avant-garde theater company based in New York City. Founded in 1970, the company took its name from an old mining town in northern Nova Scotia, near where founding members JoAnne Akalaitis, Lee Breuer, Philip Glass, Ruth Maleczech, and David Warrilow, developed <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Red Horse Animation</span>, the group's first original performance piece. Since then Mabou Mines has produced scores of plays, collaborated with well-known writers, musicians, visual artists, and filmmakers, garnered heaps of critical praise and awards, and performed around the globe, cementing its reputation as an innovative force in the theater world. The company's official website is maboumines.org. </p><p> Lee Breuer and Ruth Maleczech met studying theater at UCLA in the late 1950s. Around 1960, the couple hitchhiked to San Francisco to participate in the city's active theater scene. Working at the San Francisco Actor's Workshop and the San Francisco Mime Troupe they met Bill Raymond, and at the San Francisco Tape Music Center they met JoAnne Akalaitis. In 1964 Akalaitis moved to New York City but left for Paris soon after with composer (and future husband) Philip Glass. The following year Breuer and Maleczech left San Francisco for Europe. The two couples met up while traveling in Greece, went back to Paris, and with actor David Warrilow, began to work on staging Samuel Beckett's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Play</span>. It premiered at the American Cultural Center in 1967. It was also in Paris that the group first met actor Frederick Neumann. In 1969, back in New York with Glass, Akalaitis wrote the others in Paris suggesting they form a theater group in New York. </p><p> "Mabou Mines came together as a group to create formal works that would explore language and acting. They had a strong desire to collectively exercise complete artistic control over the work."1 Influenced especially by Jerzy Grotowski's teaching and Beckett's work, Mabou Mines went on to produce experimental theater pieces like Breuer's <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Red Horse Animation</span>pieces that resulted from intense collaboration and improvisation, and incorporated elements of visual art, dance, mime, puppetry, and music. <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Arc Welding Piece</span> (1972), for example, featured an artist using an arc welder to make cuts in a large piece of metal, while actors expressed various states of emotion, their faces enlarged by magnifying lenses. In 1974, Fred Neumann joined the group to work on Breuer's second "Animation," <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The B. Beaver Animation</span>. Bill Raymond joined shortly thereafter. </p><p> In its early years, Mabou Mines moved easily between the art world and the theater, often performing in galleries as well as stages. But its work with Beckett's writing firmly situated the group within a theatrical context. "Mabou Mines has produced eight pieces by Samuel Beckett [ <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Cascando, Come and Go, Company, Imagination Dead Imagine, The Lost Ones, Mercier and Camier, Play, Worstward Ho</span>], six of which have been world premieres of texts not originally written for the theatre. These productions have led to Mabou Mines being considered one of the foremost interpreters of Beckett's work."2 After an early residency at La Mama Experimental Theatre Club in New York, the company began performing at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, and other venues in New York and elsewhere. </p><p> From the beginning, creative roles were fluid and collaboration was key, but Lee Breuer served as the company's primary director. In 1975 however, Akalaitis directed <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Cascando</span> and opened the door for other members to take on new roles, for the company to expand, and for multiple projects to come together simultaneously. Akalaitis went on to direct <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Dressed Like an Egg </span>(1977) and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Southern Exposure </span>(1979), and wrote and directed <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Dead End Kids </span> (1980); Neumann directed <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Mercier and Camier </span>(1979); Maleczech directed <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Vanishing Pictures </span>(1980). Other performers worked with Mabou Mines, including L.B. Dallas, Linda Hartinian, Ellen McElduff, Greg Mehrten, Terry O'Reilly, and B-St. John Schofield. </p><p> The company steadily expanded its repertoire and continued its tradition of collaboration, working with talented performers and artists, including composers Bob Telson, John Zorn, Pauline Oliveros, and David Byrne. Mabou Mines has adapted works by Shakespeare ( <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Lear</span>, 1990), Franz Xaver Kroetz ( <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Through the Leaves</span>, 1984; <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Help Wanted</span>, 1986), Philip K. Dick ( <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</span>, 1985), and Bertolt Brecht ( <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">In the Jungle of Cities</span>, 1991). The company has toured extensively in the United States and abroad. </p><p> Mabou Mines has remained committed to its ideal of complete artistic control. "All decisions, artistic and administrative, large and small, are made by the company members, and each member functions variously as producer, designer, actor, writer, or director for the other. Additionally all participate as members of the Board of Directors."3 </p><p> As the company stated in a 1990 press kit, "The artistic purpose of Mabou Mines has been and remains the creation of new theatre pieces from original texts and the theatrical use of existing texts staged from a specific point of view. Each member is encouraged to pursue his or her artistic vision by initiating and collaborating on a wide range of projects of varying styles, developing them from initial concept to final performance. This process is intense and often lengthy. While the director of a Mabou Mines work is responsible for its concept and its basic structure, the ultimate production reflects the concerns and the artistic input of all its collaborators."4 </p><p> References: <br> 1.

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">The Mabou Mines Archive</span> contains an extremely diverse array of materials that comprehensively document the first 25 years of Mabou Mines, the New York City-based avant-garde theater company. The collection includes materials that document the innovative methods used by Mabou Mines to create unique theatrical adaptations from existing, often classical texts. Collaboration is a key element of Mabou Mines's artistic vision. All decisions, artistic and administrative, large and small, are made by the company members, and each member functions variously as producer, designer, actor, writer, or director. Additionally, all participate as members of the Board of Directors. Materials in the archive reflect this intensely collaborative environment. </p><p> The collection contains a wealth of production materials that document all aspects of theatrical production. It includes invaluable administrative records that reflect how the organization sustained, promoted, and financially supported its mission. Also included are scripts, programs, photographic documentation, production books and touring files, and extensive video documentation of most productions. As one of the leading interpreters of the literary works of Samuel Beckett, the collection contains correspondence between Beckett and Ruth Maleczech and Lee Breuer. </p><p> Known for their innovative incorporation of technology in theatrical productions, the Mabou Mines Archive contains extensive film, video, and audio production elements and supporting documentation. </p><p> The collection will be of interest to researchers working in the areas of avant-garde performance, performance art, experimental theatre, New York theater history and artistic collaborations, as well as to researchers examining the contemporary intersection between experimental theater, mime, music, poetry and the visual arts. </p><p> Numerous oversize items found at the end of each of the series include design plots, posters, oversize printed matter and other promotional materials housed in boxes and map cases. </p>

  <div>
      <p> In August 2017, four items were prepared to be moved to offsite art storage in September 2017. In 2019, 108 posters were located in a trunk and surveyed for preservation needs. Rolled posters were humidified and dried under weight, tears were mended, adhesive residue was reduced, and tape was trimmed. These posters were integrated into the collection as a new series (Series XV) in accordance with the collection's existing arrangement structure. </p>

</div><div class="formattednote arrangement" id ="aspace_6bc0b0ca0b428b3f63fae54ba623fb18">
  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Arrangement</h3>
  <div>
      <p> For the most part, materials are arranged alphabetically. Production related materials are arranged alphabetically by production title with subseries for materials documenting different performance venues arranged chronogically. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically by correspondent. Photographs and slides are arranged alphabetically by the name of the subject or production title that the materials document. Scripts and production books are arranged alphabetically by production title. Videorecordings are also arranged alphabetically by production title. </p><p> Series XII: Financial Files, Grants and Development and Series XIII: Administrative Files were processed at the box level. </p><p> All efforts were made to preserve the original arrangement of the collection. </p>
