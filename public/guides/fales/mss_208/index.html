    <p>Sylvester Manor is the home of the original European settlers on Shelter Island in eastern Long Island, New York, created in 1652 with the arrival of Nathaniel and Grissell Sylvester. For over 350 years and continuing to this day, the Manor has remained with descendents of the original Sylvesters, and the Sylvester Manor Archive contains documents dating from its mid-17th century European settlement to the late-20th century. The earliest documents provide evidence of an operational northern provisioning plantation involved in the Atlantic trade of the 17th century, while later portions of the collection document the lives of several notable descendents including: Ezra L'Hommedieu, an attorney and politician from the American Revolutionary Era, Samuel Smith Gardiner, an attorney from a prominent family of eastern Long Island, and Eben Norton Horsford, successful entrepreneur and  scientist at the forefront of the development of American food science and chemistry.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Sylvester Manor and its grounds are located on Shelter Island, an 8,000-acre island situated between the north and south forks of eastern Long Island that was inhabited by Manhansett Native Americans until its purchase in 1651 by the first permanent European settlers. Nathaniel Sylvester, an Englishman born and raised in Amsterdam, and three Barbadian planters, his brother, Constant, Thomas Middleton, and Thomas Rouse, bought the property to use in the Caribbean provisioning trade. Enslaved Africans, impressed Natives, and European indentured servants raised livestock, produced timber for barrels, and grew food to sell in the West Indies, where most arable land was devoted to valuable sugar cane. In 1653, Nathaniel (Nathaniell in most records) Sylvester and his wife Grissell Brinley (also recorded Grizzell), married and moved to Shelter Island, creating the establishment that would later bear their family name. The property was granted royal manor status by Governor Richard Nicoll of New York Colony in 1666. </p><p> In 1752 with the death of Brinley Sylvester, the estate passed to his daughter, Mary (Nathaniel's great-great granddaughter), and her husband Thomas Dering. The Manor remained in the Dering family for another two generations before debt forced the sale of the property. Dering records do not appear in any number in the Archive. The property was purchased from the Derings in 1827 by Samuel Smith Gardiner, a Suffolk County and New York attorney who had married into a different branch of Sylvester descendents. </p><p> Samuel Gardiner's wife was Mary Catherine L'Hommedieu, the daughter of Ezra L'Hommedieu, a very prominent attorney, national and state political representative, Suffolk County Clerk for some twenty years, and a great-great grandson of Nathaniel Sylvester. Although Ezra L'Hommedieu never owned Sylvester Manor, the collection houses a substantial volume of his papers. The Gardiners produced three daughters, Mary L'Hommedieu Gardiner, Phoebe Dayton Gardiner (sometimes spelled Phebe, particularly in earlier records), and Frances (Fanny) Gardiner. </p><p> Mary L'Hommedieu Gardiner wed Eben Norton Horsford, a professor of chemistry at Harvard University, a pioneer in food science, and founder of the Rumford Chemical Works in Providence, Rhode Island. Mary and E.N. produced four daughters, Lillian (also Lilian), Mary Katherine (Kate), Gertrude, and Mary Gardiner (Mamie). Mary died in 1855, and E.N. Horsford married her sister Phoebe two years later. Phoebe gave birth to one daughter, Cornelia Conway Fenton (referred to as Nellie in her younger years). Samuel Gardiner died in 1859, passing the Manor to Phoebe and E.N. Horsford, at which time it became a summer home, as the Horsfords were well established in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Following  her mother's death in 1903, Cornelia Horsford, who never married,  retained the property until her death in 1944.  The property then passed to the Fiske family, a family of Boston attorneys into which Gertrude Horsford had married. Augustus Henry Fiske briefly inherited the Manor before passing the estate to his son Andrew, who held the Manor from 1949 until his death in 1992. His widow, Alice Hench Fiske, retained life interest until her death in 2006.  </p><p> The original house was probably constructed soon after Nathaniel and Grissell's arrival. Provisioning activities likely ended in 1680 at Nathaniel's death, but farming and trading continued. After Brinley Sylvester, a successful merchant operating regionally in the New England and New York sphere,  tore down the first dwelling, he constructed the current surviving house around 1735. By the time Samuel Gardiner became the owner of the manor in the early 19th century, the Manor property had been significantly reduced and much of the remaining arable land was leased to local farmers. When the Horsfords took possession of the manor, they hosted members of Boston's intellectual and social elite during the summers. While some small-scale farming continued, the existing gardens were formalized and expanded. The Horsfords set up monuments and fenced enclosures, including two extant graveyards, to relate their understanding of the landscape features of the property's history.  After her mother's death, Cornelia Horsford maintained the home as a summer residence; continuing work on the gardens and overseeing a substantial renovation to the residence by the well-known architect, Henry Bacon, in 1908. </p><p> The estate currently comprises approximately 243 acres including the manor house, several subsidiary houses, as well as barns and out-buildings, most of which date to the nineteenth century. Sylvester Manor remains in the possession of family descendents and is today being cultivated as an educational organic farm. In addition, nine seasons of field schools were conducted by archaeological teams from the University of Massachusetts Boston, providing further information on the original buildings and activities conducted on the site. See http://www.fiskecenter.umb.edu/excavations.htm for information on the archaeological activities. </p><p>

      <p> The Sylvester Manor Archive includes correspondence, financial records, manuscripts, photographs, artworks, and realia from the owners and related family members of the Sylvester Manor. These materials document over 350 years of American history. The earliest items are legal and financial documentation such as land deeds pertaining to the purchase of property on Long Island, and includes the signature of noted Mantaukett tribe sachem Wyandanch. The earliest items also document Atlantic trade of the late 17th and early 18th century through wills and ledgers. Later records are the largely the personal records of the individuals who lived at Sylvester Manor, several of whom had noteworthy careers in their respective fields. The records of three individuals comprise the bulk of the collection: Ezra L'Hommedieu, a prominent attorney and politician; Samuel Smith Gardiner, a Long Island and New York attorney; and Eben Norton Horsford, an early leader in food chemistry and owner of the Rumford Chemical Works. Other significant groups of records include the early records of the Sylvester, Brinley, and Lloyd families, as well as the papers of Cornelia Horsford. A significant number of photographs dating from approximately the 1870's through the 1930's document Sylvester Manor and its grounds as well as members of the Horsford and Fiske families. </p>

  <div>
      <p> Between 2008-2010, the Sylvester Manor Archive was arranged into record groups by family affiliation, then subdivided into series consisting of individuals' papers, and then chronologically. The finding aid published in 2010 consisted of record titles that described both creator and genre. Sponsored by the R.D.L. Gardiner Foundation, descriptive enhancements were added to the finding aid from 2014-2015. Scope and content notes in the correspondence series of Record Groups I, III, IV, and V now include physical details and subject information about the personal and professional lives of the Sylvester, Brinley, Lloyd, Gardiner, Horsford, and Fiske families. Record Group I also includes descriptive enhancements to its financial and legal records. During the course of these revisions, creator and genre information were separated into different descriptive fields; some items of similar genre or subject were consolidated; and some items received preservation treatment. For these reasons, the current finding aid reflects changes in box and folder locations.  </p><p> The Sylvester Manor Archive finding aid published in 2010 without these descriptive enhancements is available by request.  </p><p> Approximately 50 nitrate negatives, found in the repository during processing in 2016, were described in the finding aid and digitized. The nitrate negatives were transferred to New York City for safe destruction once the digitization process was completed. </p>

These record groups are then subdivided into series consisting of individuals' papers. Women that crossed family divisions, such as Mary Catherine L'Hommedieu Gardiner, and Phoebe Dayton Gardiner Horsford, were included in their married family because most records date from after marriage. Subseries are grouped by the document or material types. Most materials are arranged chronologically except where noted; correspondence is arranged alphabetically by correspondent and then chronologically where applicable. </p><p> RECORD GROUP I: Sylvester and Early Familes </p><p> Series A: Sylvester Family </p><p> Series B: Brinley Family </p><p> Series C: Lloyd Family </p><p> RECORD GROUP II: L'Hommedieu Family </p><p> Series A: Benjamin L'Hommedieu II </p><p> Series B: Ezra L'Hommedieu
