    <p>The New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) was founded in 1971 in New York City by a group of artists who were part of the New York State Department of Cultural Affairs (NYSCA) to create an organization that would provide artists like themselves with resources guidance and funding for their art projects that NYSCA could not provide directly. NYFA grew over the decades to become one of the leading organizations providing grants and services in New York City, New York State, and in the country. NYFA's programs are dedicated to providing guidance and support for artists and smaller arts organizations seeking city, state, and federal organization funding.  This collection documents NYFA's nearly 50 year history including individual artist and small arts organization grant recipient files with applications/project descriptions, agreements, project advice, panel critiques, promotional information, and artist work samples. This collection also includes founding documents, marketing material, financial and budgetary information, NYFA Board of Director files, and administrative/human resources information.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The New York Foundation for the Arts Records consists of the organization's materials for close to 50 years. The materials highlight the organization's mission to fulfill its vision in empowering emerging artists and arts organizations across all creative disciplines. The collection begins with administrative materials under Human Resources that detail committee meetings and retreats, employee handbooks and position descriptions, and office space contracts for other organization's sharing work space with NYFA. Board materials include agenda packets with meeting minutes, memorandum, and executive reports written by Ted Berger. Ted Berger's paper collection during his stint as Executive Director for NYFA is also included along with the Board's collection. The Development department's documents provide marketing materials for the annual fund, as well as NYSCA reports, and correspondence. The Finance department contributes its annual financial reports in generated in documenting the organization's yearly budget and loss, payroll, and tax returns. The Communications department adds to the mix of documents with outreach materials such as general brochures, publications, and original printed materials in support of NYFA programs made available to artists and arts organizations. A bulk of NYFA's records consist of grant applications and materials submitted by artists and arts organizations for opportunities that support the development of artists fellowships, individual and organizational art projects, arts in education implementation initiatives, and disaster relief and wage subsidy programs for events like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. These grant applications were also submitted to NYFA for opportunities in technology implementation by artists and arts organizations and artists' grants and cultural mission trips in Israel. </p>

  <div>
      <p> Originally, files and audio/visual material were boxed up in the NYFA offices every couple of years and sent to storage with minimal descriptions. Most of these files are arranged chronologically, but there are scattered "miscellaneous" boxes. Materials were usually grouped by program, including Artist Fellowship, Fiscal Sponsorship, Strategic Opportunity Stipends, New York Arts Recovery Fund, among others. There are also boxes of unorganized founding files, accumulated by the first director of the organization, Theodore S. Berger. Various administrative NYFA files exist, but are not in any particular order. The collection has been rehoused in archival boxes and folders, arranged into series that reflects the organization's activities, and described at the collection-, series-, and subseries-level. </p>
