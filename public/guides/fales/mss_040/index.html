    <p>John Canemaker (b. 1943) is an internationally recognized independent animator, animation historian, author, teacher and lecturer. Since 1988, he has directed the animation program at the Tisch School of the Arts' Kanbar Institute of Film and Television. He has also been a Guest Fellow at Yale University. Canemaker's interest in animation began in childhood, and it has moved him to write more than 100 articles on the subject, as well as several books, including the story of the making of Richard Williams' Raggedy Ann & Andy entitled: The Animated Raggedy Ann & Andy (1977). Canemaker's own films include:'The 40's' (1974), 'Bottom's Dream' (1983), 'The Hunger Project' (1987), animation sequences for 'The World According To Garp'(1981), 'You Don't Have To Die' (1988) which received an Academy Award, Confessions of a Stand-Up (1993), and Bridgehampton (1998). Canemaker began collecting the material that comprises this collection in the early 1970's, and eventually obtained a wealth of material about the history, technique,and cultural significance of animated films. Items include animation resources such as: documentary material, drawings, posters, storyboards, recorded interviews and lectures, personal research materials for his articles and books, and periodicals.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> John Canemaker (b. 1943) is an internationally recognized independent animator, animation <span class="ead-occupation">historian</span>, <span class="ead-occupation">author</span>, <span class="ead-occupation">teacher</span>and <span class="ead-occupation">lecturer</span>. In 1980, he began teaching and developing the animation program at <span class="ead-corpname">New York University</span>, <span class="ead-corpname">Tisch School of the Arts'</span><span class="ead-corpname">Kanbar Institute of Film and Television Department</span>. Since 1988 he has directed the program and is currently a tenured full professor. From 2001-2002 he was Acting Chair of the NYU Undergraduate Film and Television Department. </p><p> Raised in <span class="ead-geogname">Elmira, New York</span>, Canemaker began an acting career which included off-Broadway and advertising work in New York City from 1961 to 1965. In 1967, after a two-year stint in the Army, Canemaker, with funds from acting assignments in TV commercials (he appeared in over 35 advertisements for major products), obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from <span class="ead-corpname">Marymount Manhattan College</span>in 1974 and Master of Fine Arts in Film from <span class="ead-corpname">New York University</span>in 1976. </p><p> While studying for his Bachelor of Arts degree, Canemaker's childhood interest in animation revived. He began making sponsored animated shorts and wrote the first of more than 100 articles on animation history. His first book, the story of the making of Richard Williams' RAGGEDY ANN and ANDY, was published in 1977 as "The Animated Raggedy Ann and Andy." In 1982, he wrote the introduction to "Treasures of Disney Animation Art," and, in 1987, he published, "Winsor McCay - His Life and Art," and, in 1991, "Felix, the Twisted Tale of the World's Most Famous Cat." There followed "Tex Avery: The MGM Years" and "Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists (both in 1997), "Paper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney Storyboards" (1999), "Walt Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation" (2001), and "The Art and Flair of Mary Blair" (2003). Research material from all of these books now resides in the Fales Library. "Lucy Goes to the Country," a 1998 children's book collaboration with Joseph Kennedy, contains illustrations by Canemaker. </p><p> His research in the history of animation inspired two of his own films, REMEMBERING WINSOR McCAY (1976) and OTTO MESSMER and FELIX THE CAT (1977). </p><p> Canemaker's filmography includes independently-made animated shorts that are part of the permanent collection of New York's <span class="ead-corpname">Museum of Modern Art</span>. Among them: THE 40's (1974), STREET FREAKS (1975), CONFESSIONS OF ASTARDREAMER (1978), THE WIZARD'S SON (1981), BOTTOM'S DREAM (1983),CONFESSIONS OF A STAND-UP (1993), BRIDGEHAMPTON (1998), THE MOON AND THE SON: AN IMAGINED CONVERSATION (2004) a 28-minute film about Canemaker's father. </p><p> In the early 1980's, Canemaker animated several <span class="ead-corpname">Children's Television Workshop</span>films, TV commercials, and, in 1981, created the animation sequences for the Warner Bros. feature THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. He designed and directed animation sequences in the Academy Award-winning <span class="ead-corpname">HBO</span>documentary YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIE (1988) and the <span class="ead-corpname">Peabody Award</span>-winning <span class="ead-corpname">CBS</span>documentary BREAK THE SILENCE: KIDS AGAINST CHILD ABUSE (1994). </p><p> JOHN CANEMAKER: MARCHING TO A DIFFERENT TOON, a DVD/home video collection of his films, is distributed by Milestone Film & Video/Image Entertainment. In addition, Canemaker writes regularly on animation for the <span class="ead-corpname">New York Times</span>and is on-camera and audio commentator for DVD versions of THE FANTASIA ANTHOLOGY, DUMBO, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, PETER PAN, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, CUT-UP: THE FILMS OF GRANT MUNRO, and WINSOR McCAY: THE MASTER EDITION. He has appeared on <span class="ead-corpname">NBC</span>'s TODAY, <span class="ead-corpname">PBS</span>'s NEWS HOUR WITH JIM LEHRER,and ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, and has lectured throughout the United States and in Brazil, Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, and Wales. </p><p> For more information, visit: http://www.johncanemaker.com </p><p> FILMOGRAPHY: Selected Personal Films: </p><p> FILMOGRAPHY: Selected Sponsored Films: </p><p> FILM RETROSPECTIVES: </p><p> BOOKS WRITTEN BY JOHN CANEMAKER: </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Canemaker began collecting this material in the early 1970's establishing a rich resource devoted to the history, technique, and cultural significance of film animation. The collection has been enlarged with subsequent donations from Canemaker of additional material of historical and contemporary interest. The collection serves the needs both of Canemaker's students at the University's Tisch School ofthe Arts and of all researchers in the history and technique of film animation. </p><p> The John Canemaker Animation Collection housed in the Fales Library consists of documentary and graphic materials and is asource of information on personalities and subjects, both American and foreign, important to the history of film animation. </p><p> While the collection includes copies of original material dating from the beginnings of film animation at the end of the nineteenth century, the original material concentrates on the late 1970's and the 1980's. Significant portions of the collection relate to Walt Disney and hisstudio, and to Canemaker's own extensive creative and research activity, and publications. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES DESCRIPTIONS:</span>  </p><p> NOTE: The container list has some anomalies that warrant explanation. Items in the original collection have been listed in alphabetical order by subject in precedence over physical location of an item. In other words, box 21, folder 171 may be referred to a number of times because it contains information on a few different persons or films. Functionally, the container list was made into an index/container list in the interest of assisting researchers in finding pertinent material on a particular topic. Initially, new material and indexed material were then inserted into the alphabetical sequence of the series and subseries but maintained in a separate box. The end result is that one will come upon a folder that is not in the same box as the previous item listed in the folder sequence of the series. There are also numerous "see" references within each series' alphabetical sequence. </p><p> Beginning with new material received after 2000, Accretions were maintained (See Accretions for 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2008). Here, new material was processed according to the original series-subseries structure, but kept separate from the original collection - no interfiling was done. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SERIES I: Documentary material</span>  </p><p> Series I consists of documentary material placed either in Subseries A, when it deals with more than one personality or with a general topic in animation, or in Subseries B, when the material is primarily about or by one personality. This is an adaptation of the "auteur" theory in film criticism, which credits the director as the most important creative force behind a film. In film animation, the "auteur" is usually the working animator, but producers, directors, studio owners (e.g., Walt Disney and Walter Lantz) and character voices (e.g., Mel Blanc and June Foray) are also accorded individual attention in this subseries. </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Documentary material includes:</span> </span><span class="ead-item">1.Manuscript and published versions of interviews with leading personalities in film animation.</span><span class="ead-item">2. Texts of animation courses.</span><span class="ead-item">3. Canemaker's research notes on people and films.</span><span class="ead-item">4. Correspondence.</span><span class="ead-item">5. Film production/work drafts, budgets, scripts, proposals, action outlines, and other production information.</span><span class="ead-item">6. Copies or originals of newspaper and periodical articles.</span><span class="ead-item">7. Flyers, brochures, catalogs, public relations and press releases relating to films, screenings, animation companies and festivals.</span><span class="ead-item">8. Resumes and biographies.</span></span>  </p><p> The material in each folder is arranged chronologically in the following order: correspondence; other related material; newspaper and periodical articles. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Subseries A: Subjects.</span>  </p><p> The largest amount of material in this subseries consists of programs from animation film festivals and screenings (1967-1987), representing the work of hundreds of animators from around the world. The programs, often richly illustrated, are a useful source for compiling filmographies and for biographical data. Information about foreign film festivals in the International files provides an overview of a particular country's animated film production. </p><p> Many illustrated catalogs, issued between 1977 and 1988 by Gallery Lainzberg, Museum Graphics, Sotheby, and others, are included under "Art and Collecting" and provide information about animators and films. Primarily, however, this material is interesting for showing the development of animation art as a "collectible." Catalogs in Subseries A include works of more than one animator; catalogs devoted to one animator are filed under the name in Subseries B. </p><p> The <span class="ead-corpname">Walter Lantz Conference on Animation</span>, sponsored by the American Film Institute in 1987 and 1988, published a volume titled, each year, The Art of the Animated Image, with the subtitle "an Anthology" in 1987 and "Storytelling in Animation" in 1988. John Canemaker edited the 1988 edition. Besides containing transcripts of panel discussions, there are contributions by historians and practitioners of animation.  </p><p> Material about animation in the United Kingdom, is the largest in the International category and contains items collected during Canemaker's 1979 trip to England. </p><p> The Theory and Technique folder contains the text of a 1936 layout training course by Tom Codrick and Charles Philippi; material on an animation seminar at the New School in 1979; and articles relating to technical aspects of animation and the new field of computer animation. </p><p> The UCLA Oral History of the Motion Picture in America interviews (1969) have been sorted among the interviewees' folders: Tex Avery, Dave Fleischer, Fritz Freleng, and Richard Huemer. The Huemer folder also contains correspondence Canemaker had with UCLA regarding restrictions on the use of Huemer's interview. </p><p> Art Babbitt, a Disney animator, gave a series of lectures in London in July, 1973. There are two copies of these lectures, one on acid-free paper, and five interviews (1971-1979) by Canemaker with this important artist. </p><p> John Canemaker's own career as an historian and practitioner of animation spans the years from 1973, when he first visited the Disney Studios, to the animation he created for the 1988 Academy Award winning documentary, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIE. The general folders also include documentation on Canemaker's military, acting, and university careers (1965-1974). While his journalistic work generally is filed under the subjects and people treated, material from his books and films is included. Series I contains documentary material and Series II, the artwork for the films. In addition to the technical aspects of <span class="ead-occupation">filmmaking</span>, the materials collected give insight into the problems of financing and the teamwork required to produce a film. The complete screenplay of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP is in this series. Reviews and articles about the films evaluate the results of the enormous effort involved.
