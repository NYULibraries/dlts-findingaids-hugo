      <p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">David Michael Wojnarowicz
</span> </p><p> David Michael Wojnarowicz was an openly gay artist, writer, and activist who chronicled a late-twentieth century New York ravaged by AIDS. His multi-media work is notable for combining elements of personal narrative with erotic, often confrontational imagery.   </p><p> Wojnarowicz was born on September 14, 1954 in Red Bank, New Jersey. Following his parents' divorce, Wojnarowicz moved with his mother to New York City, where he claims he began hustling at age eleven. He attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan for a time, although he never graduated.  Wojnarowicz left his mother's apartment at age sixteen to live on the streets, where for two years he was a victim of numerous assaults, before seeking shelter at a halfway house. </p><p> In the ensuing years, Wojnarowicz traveled, often by hopping trains and hitchhiking. He lived in San Francisco, as well as in France with his sister, before eventually returning to New York, where he worked as a busboy or janitor to support himself and his art. His activities at this time included performing in a band (Three Teens Kill 4 - No Motive) featuring children's instruments and tape recordings of found sounds, and documenting the Lower West Side's marginal characters through his film, writing and photography.  His well-known series <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Arthur Rimbaud in New York</span>, featuring images of the artist wearing a photographic mask of the symbolist poet, was created in 1978-79. </p><p> In the early 80s Wojnarowicz became known in the East Village art scene for making use of re-contextualized stencils, found maps, and grocery-store price signs to produce stark tableaux. By the mid-80s, after the death of his lover, the photographer Peter Hujar, and his own diagnosis with the disease, AIDS became a constant undercurrent in his work. The artist continued to work with images of decay, disaster and sexuality, adopting a militant stance against what he perceived as the complacency and ignorance surrounding the disease. An iconic image of the Wojnarowicz from this time appears in the film <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Silence = Death</span>, where he appears with his mouth sewn shut in a reference to the ACT-UP slogan. </p><p> At this controversial point in his career he was drafted in the "culture wars": the NEA rescinded and finally restored funding for an exhibition catalog in which he attacked various public figures, and he was criticized by both a member of Congress and the American Family Association. His book <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration</span> was published in 1991. He continued to produce work until his death in 1992 at age 37. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">SOURCES:</span> </p><p> "David Michael Wojnarowicz."The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Volume 3: 1991-1993.

<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Janine Pommy Vega</span> </p><p> Janine Pommy Vega is a poet, performance artist, and lecturer.  In the early 1960s in Greenwich Village, she met Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg and other writers who would later become known as the beat generation. After the death of her husband, the Peruvian painter Fernando Vega, her book <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Poems to Fernando</span> (1968) was published by City Lights Books. In the 1970s, Pommy Vega traveled to Colombia and Peru on a pilgrimage in search of the female divinity, settling at Lake Titicaca and writing the books <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Journal of a Hermit</span> (1974) and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Morning Passage</span> (1976).  She has been involved with poetry-in-the-prisons programs and New York Poets in the Schools, and has worked as a story-teller in homes for the aged, reform schools, and for Headstart Projects. She has said about her spiritual beliefs: "All religions pass by many roads to the Same Place; I worship the One." </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Bibliography</span><br> </p><p> Poems<br> </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Poems to Fernando</span>, City Lights (San Francisco, CA), 1968; Kraus Reprint Company (Millwood, NY), 1973.<br>
