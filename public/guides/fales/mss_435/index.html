  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Located at 101 Avenue A in the East Village, the Pyramid Club was an important nightclub for the 1980's and 90's downtown New York scene. Pyramid began as a standard dive bar, but evolved into the epicenter of a diverse underground art and performance scene under the attentions of Bobby Bradley, Alan Mace and Victor Sapienza. All three men were employees at the nightclub Interferon, and were later joined by Brian Butterick, who had been an employee at Mudd Club. Home to many of the most well known drag performers of the time, such as Lady Bunny and Ethyl Eichelberger, Pyramid was also a cornerstone in the neighborhood's LGBT community. It opened officially as a nightclub in December of 1981 and continues to operate today, largely as a throwback 80's dance club. </p><p> In addition to performance, the club hosted art exhibitions, film screenings and live readings by artists like Lydia Lunch and David Wojnarowicz. It hosted a number of films emerging from the No Wave and Cinema of Transgression scenes. It was home to John Jesurun's serial performance piece,<span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic"> Chang in a Void Moon</span>, which ran at the Pyramid Club for a year and continues today at other venues internationally. <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Chang in a Void Moon</span> was followed by Kestutis Nakas' <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Titus Andronicus</span>. Pyramid was also the birthplace of Wigstock, which first occurred in Tompkin's Square Park and was organized by Lady Bunny. </p>
