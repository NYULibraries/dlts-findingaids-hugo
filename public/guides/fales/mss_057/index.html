It also contains drawings by his foremost illustrators John Tenniel and Harry Furniss. Additionally, there is a wide cross section of ephemeral materials related to Lewis Carroll which illustrate his work's contemporary and ongoing cultural impact, as well as, Alfred C. Berol's correspondence and notes on the provenance of the materials in the collection.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note:</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Alfred C. Berol (1892-1974), who assembled this substantial collection of Lewis Carrol letters, manuscripts and ephemera, was the president of the Eagle Pencil Company (later renamed Berol Corp.) of Danbury, Connecticut. Though an avid collector of a wide array of rare books and manuscripts, Berol was a particularly ardent collector of Lewis Carroll materials . </p><p> Lewis Carroll, the pseudonym used by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, was born in Daresbury, Cheshire, England in 1832. He was a writer, teacher, photography enthusiast, mathematician and Oxford don. While Lecturer in Mathematics at Oxford, Dodgson met Alice Liddell who was the daughter of the Dean of Christ Church College. Alice Liddell became the inspiration for Dodgson's abiding classic of children's literature: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. </p>

  <div>
      <p> This finding aid describes a portion of the Alfred C. Berol collection of Lewis Carroll materials, which can by found at the Fales Library. The Fales Library is the primary special collections division of the NYU libraries, housing over 200,000 volumes of English and American Literature from 1700 to the present. Strengths of the Collection include the development of the English and American novel, with an emphasis on the Gothic, the Victorian novel, the Edwardian Novel, and New York Writing. </p><p> The Alfred C. Berol Collection of Lewis Carroll is one of the pre-eminent collections of Lewis Carroll materials in the United States. The archival portion of the collection contains correspondence, manuscripts (firsts, autographed copies, presentation copies, and proofs), drawings, and photographs of Charles L. Dodgson. It also contains drawings by his foremost illustrators John Tenniel and Harry Furniss. Many of the items in the collection are unique. Additionally, there is a wide cross section of ephemeral materials related to Carroll which illustrate his work's contemporary and ongoing cultural impact. It also contains Alfred C. Berol's correspondence and notes on the provenance of the materials in the collection. </p><p> This finding aid is the result of reprocessing the collection and imposing standard manuscript processing rules on the materials. The preliminary checklist of the collection prepared by John Frost and George Winchester Stone in 1975, soon after the collection arrived at NYU, never adequately provided for either intellectual control of the materials or adequate and efficient scholarly access to the materials. This finding aid rectifies the numerous inconsistencies, repetitions, and errors in the preliminary checklist, finally giving the research scholar an adequate tool for truly effective access to the Alfred C. Berol Collection. </p><p> <span class="ead-title">SERIES DESCRIPTION</span>  </p><p> <span class="ead-title">SERIES 1: Correspondence</span>  </p><p> The letters have been processed at the item level, and the correspondence is arranged alphabetically by recipient. If there is more than one letter to a recipient, the letters are arranged chronologically, with the undated letters appearing at the end of the sequence. </p><p> An exemplary entry from this section: </p><p> 1. Dodgson, Charles <br>To the Duchess of Albany; ALs, 2pp <br>Christ Church, Oxford, November 30, 1893 <br>(XIX 557) </p><p> Each entry may have up to five fields, the first the name of the author of the letter, the second the name of the recipient, the third a description of the letter, the fourth the place and date of the letter's composition. The fifth field is for notes, and if the letter was marked with a number in grease-pencil by Frost as he made up his checklist, that number is found in parentheses at the beginning of the notes field. Not all documents have been marked by Frost, and some documents may have no notes field at all. Some items may also have a Cohen number, which will appear at the very end of the record. </p><p> Subseries A contains correspondence from Charles L. Dodgson to numerous contemporaries. </p><p> Subseries B contains correspondence to Charles L. Dodgson from numerous contemporaries. </p><p> Subseries C has contemporary correspondence which does not involve Dodgson. </p><p> Subseries D contains calling cards. </p><p> <span class="ead-title">SERIES 2: Manuscripts</span>  </p><p> The manuscripts have been processed at the item level. </p><p> An exemplary entry from this section: </p><p> 492.
