  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Shael Shapiro is an architect whose practice was largely based in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, N.Y. He studied architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, N.Y., and moved to SoHo in 1967, living in one of the artist George Macuinas's Flux Houses on Wooster Street. Shapiro worked on architectural projects throughout New York City, but his most significant work was focused on artists' lofts in downtown Manhattan. Shapiro was instrumental in the writing and passage of the so-called "Loft Law," enacted in 1971, which allowed artists to legally live in lofts downtown, and helped shape the growing community of artists in 1970s SoHo. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Shael Shapiro Papers consists of architectural drawings and reproductions, correspondence, building specifications, photographs (primarily building exteriors and interior details), inspection reports, architect's and engineer's reports, floppy disks, financial and legal documents related to his architectural practice on Wooster Street in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, N.Y. from the 1970s to the early 2000s. The architectural drawings and reproductions found in the collection include floor plans, elevations, details, structural, plumbing and mechanical drawings, and some sketches. Most reproductions are diazotypes or ink on plastic, and most original drawings are graphite and/or ink on paper or on plastic. Some architectural drawings and reproductions were produced by consulting engineering firms, most often by WYS Design Partnership, Consulting Engineers. The collection also contains New York City Department of Building applications, permits and certificates, documents and correspondence with the City of New York Landmarks Preservation Commission, as well as correspondence and registrations with the New York City Loft Board. Although Shapiro's most notable work is the conversion of lofts in downtown Manhattan, the collection contains material related to projects (identified by job number and address) throughout New York City. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Processing Information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> In 2017, the collection was partially re-housed into archival boxes and folders, and some architectural reproductions and drawings were housed in temporary rolled storage boxes. A file level inventory was created for each box, but the collection was not arranged, therefore material related to a specific project may be found in multiple, non-consecutive boxes. On April 2019 floppy disks were removed from Box 24 and moved to Shared Fales 025. </p>
