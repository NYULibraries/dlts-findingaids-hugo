  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Information </h3>
  <div>
      <p> Archibald Lewis Bouton was born on September 1, 1872 in <span class="ead-geogname">Cortland, New York</span>. He received his A.B. from <span class="ead-corpname">Amherst</span> in 1896 and his M.A. from <span class="ead-corpname">Columbia</span> in 1900. He first came to <span class="ead-corpname">New York University</span> in 1898 as an instructor of English. In 1901 he became an<span class="ead-occupation"> assistant professor</span>, and then a <span class="ead-occupation">full professor </span>in 1905. In 1914 Bouton became head of the English department and also the <span class="ead-occupation">Dean of the College of Arts and Pure Science</span>.  </p><p> As a teacher and as an administrator, Bouton was deeply involved with the people and the events around him. Even while he was Dean, Bouton remained active as an instructor and a scholar. In 1916 he took a year's leave of absence to study at <span class="ead-corpname">Harvard</span>. <span class="ead-name">Marshall S. Brown</span> took over his duties as Dean for this time. Bouton used his summers to be a guest lecturer at various schools: the <span class="ead-corpname">University of California</span> in 1925, and the <span class="ead-corpname">University of Colorado</span> in 1927-1930.  </p><p> As an administrator, Bouton dealt with the events that occurred during the important years of 1914-1935. In 1919 Bouton wrote a pamphlet entitled "The Colleges and Americanism." Here he set forth the idea that American institutions of higher learning had to inculcate values of Americanism in their students. To do so, it was first necessary to find a specific "type" of student who could also maintain the high level of academic performance that his school might require. This pamphlet written by Bouton and the subsequent actions of University Administration led to the creation of the selective admissions policy at <span class="ead-corpname">University College</span> in 1919. A policy of selective admissions was without precedent in the United States, and called for the taking of a psychological test, an appearance before a personnel board and an oath of loyalty before a student could be admitted at the <span class="ead-corpname">University Heights College</span>.  </p><p> On a more personal level, Bouton was involved in the Century Club and was a founder and Vice-President of the Society of the Friends of the University of Rome. He made several trips abroad, studying, meeting with alumni, and relaxing. Such a rest trip was taken in 1931-1932. <span class="ead-name">Arthur Hill</span> became Acting Dean for this period. Bouton had earlier (1923-1924) taken a sabbatical, leaving <span class="ead-name">Perley Thorne</span> to act as Dean in his absence. Finally in 1935, Bouton was forced to take another leave, this time for health reasons. Arthur Hill again stepped in for him until <span class="ead-name">Irving Berg</span> was appointed Dean in 1936.  </p><p> Once recovered, Bouton concentrated on his teaching and became the Director of the <span class="ead-corpname">Elmer Ellsworth Brown House for English Studies</span>. Bouton died on April 18, 1941 (in Pasadena, California) after having been Dean of University College for twenty-one years, Acting Dean of the Graduate School for 1925-1927, and a teacher for forty-three years.  </p><p> Sources:  </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content </h3>
  <div>
      <p> Series I: Correspondence, 1914-1935, is an alphabetical subject file consisting of correspondence, memoranda, news clippings, and charts. It includes material on such diverse topics as departments within the University, property and facilities operated by the University, as well as extensive information concerning <span class="ead-corpname">World War I</span>. This chronicles the University's involvement and participation with the U.S. Military during and after World War I. Of special note are Bouton's correspondence concerning the relationships between the University, the military, and the public as a result of the war. Also of importance during this time period is the University's involvement with the <span class="ead-corpname">Students' Army Training Corps</span> and the <span class="ead-corpname">Reserve Officer Training Corps</span> which was an outgrowth of the University's experience with the S.A.T.C. How students felt about the University and its military involvement is reflected in correspondence with the Dean. Also included is material concerning selective admissions, the use of personnel and psychological testing, loyalty oaths, and their relationship towards using higher education to inculcate Americanizing influences upon students. </p><p>  Series II: Lecture Notes, 1899-1915; Writings, Addresses, and Publications, 1909-1941, is a chronological file consisting of fragments of lectures, exam questions, and course outlines. Included are Lecture Notes taken by Bouton in a graduate course he attended at <span class="ead-corpname">Columbia University</span>. Taught by <span class="ead-name">Professor Robinson</span> in 1899-1900 the course was entitled, "History XI." Bouton became the professor of History of English Literature at New York University in the years 1911-15 and Lecture Notes for several courses are included in this series. Also included are Writings and Addresses, 1914-1921. Publications, 1909-1934 consist of a chronological arrangement of articles, essays, and pamphlets written by Bouton. <br><br>Note! Look for a particular professor's correspondence under both the individual's name and department. </p>
