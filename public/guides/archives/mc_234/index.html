      <p> The collection was packed in large cardboard boxes upon arrival. The boxes lacked descriptive information and were discarded as the collection was rehoused in record cartons. During the initial survey, each object was given an item number unique to its box for inventory purposes. Materials were shifted to allow for safe handling and proper storage. Item-level description for the collection was generated after the survey, including color, material type, function, labels, and inscription information for each object. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Custodial History</h3>
  <div>
      <p> According to a May 12, 2013 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">New York Times</span> article by Edna Ishayik "Little Pigs, Little Pigs, Let Us In On Your History," New York University facility workers discovered the collection in a crawl space under the auditorium of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business. Paul Affuso, an associate dean at the business school, stated the collection may have been a gift to the undergraduate college, given by an alumna who had collected them during her lifetime as a hobby. A December 27, 1993 <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Chicago Tribune</span> article "For some College Gifts, Even the Thought May Not Count," by Frank James suggests that a male donor and his family gifted the collection.  </p><p> Under Affuso's direction, the collection was moved to a supply closet in the business school's Tisch Hall. The objects were unpacked and placed on bookshelves, where they remained for a few years. Professional movers were called by the facilities team to consolidate the collection, although a few figurines were pulled from the closet to show a reporter back in April 2013. It is unclear how long the boxes remained in the closet or if they were stored in another location prior to being transferred to the University Archives. </p>
