    <p>The Office of the Vice President for University Relations was created in 1957 in response to the New York University Self-Study which recognized a need for coordination between the university and the community which it served. The Public Relations Department which oversaw the Office of Publication and Printing and Information Services was administratively transferred to the Vice President for University Relations when the new office was established. Arthur L. Brandon held the Office of Vice President for University Relations from 1957 through December 31, 1963. Arthur Leon Brandon had been Director of University Relations, a member of the public relations commission of the Association of American Colleges, and president of the American College Public Relations Association (ACPRA) from 1944 to 1946. The Office of the Vice President for University Relations was dissolved in 1965. These records include: correspondence, memoranda, press releases, reports, and minutes generated by the Office during Brandon's tenure.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> The Office Of The Vice President for University Relations was created in 1957 in response to the New York University Self-Study which recognized a need for two-way communication between the university and the community which it served. The Self-Study, published in 1956, was financed by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, and represented a major attempt at long-range planning under the leadership of then Chancellor Henry T. Heald. In the same year, a restructuring of administrative titles took place at NYU: the Chancellor became President and Vice Chancellors became Vice Presidents. </p><p> The new Vice President for University Relations became responsible for dissemination of information about New York University programs, and supervision of communication with the University community, and its neighbors through NYU's radio, television and publication units. During Chancellor Heald's administration (1952-56) the Public Relations Department had been responsible for the Office of Publication and Printing and for Information Services. The responsibility for these services was administratively transferred to the Vice President for University Relations when the new office was established and the directors of both units reported to him. </p><p> Arthur Leon Brandon came to New York University in 1957 from the University of Michigan where he had been Director of University Relations. A graduate of Broaddus College (now Alderson-Broaddus), Vice President Brandon held an M.A. from Bucknell University, an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Oklahoma Baptist University and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters was conferred by Alderson-Broaddus in 1962. He was a member of the public relations commission of the Association of American Colleges and was president of the American College Public Relations Association (ACPRA) from 1944 to 1946. </p><p> Arthur L. Brandon held the Office Of Vice President for University Relations through December 31, 1963. He was succeeded by Thomas P. Robinson on January 1, 1964. The office was dissolved in 1965. </p><p>  Sources:  </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">New York University, <span class="ead-title">The New York University Self-Study Final Report</span> (Washington Square, New York: New York University Press, 1956), p.4l4.</span><span class="ead-item"><span class="ead-title">Handbook for Students At The Washington Square Center</span>, New York University Bulletin Volume LVIII.

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> This collection of records of the Office Of The Vice President for University Relations covers the period 1957 to 1962. Although Arthur L. Brandon officially held the office until December 31, 1963, there are no files for 1963. </p><p> The files in this record group represent the activities of Arthur L. Brandon from 1957 to 1962. There are a limited number of files which cover 1962 and no files for 1963. </p><p> The files contain correspondence and memoranda, press releases, reports, minutes of meetings, and carbon copies of letters and memoranda sent to Brandon for informational purposes. A significant amount of correspondence pertains to Brandon's membership in the American College Public Relations Association. </p><p> The collection had been considerably rearranged before this processing; a second rearrangement was undertaken during Fall 1986. The original transfile sheet mentioned in E. Frederic Knauth's Report to Chancellor Borowitz, 9/24/75 (Part I, No. 3), was missing. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I</span>, Folder 17 contains correspondence regarding potential administrative posts at other universities for Executive Vice President John E. Ivey, Jr. as well as a letter from Ivey to Brandon outlining his reasons for resignation from NYU. There are also handwritten notes by Brandon regarding Ivey's resignation. </p><p> Series I, Folder 20 contains a copy of a memorandum from Executive Vice President Stoddard to President Hester recommending discontinuance of the Graduate Institute of Book Publishing. </p><p> Series I, Folder 24 includes an informational note: "8/60 - Inst. of XJ Economic Affairs - covering 1957 to Aug. 60 referred to vault. Retained some items in this file that might still be active." </p><p> Series I, Folder 33 contains correspondence with respect to President Newsom's participation in <span class="ead-title">Look Magazine</span>'s Time Capsule deposited in a new office building in Des Moines, Iowa. The capsule, scheduled to be opened in 1987, included Newsom's predictions for higher education in the future. </p><p> Series I also contains a number of files dealing with NYU television programming. Cross-reference may be made to Record Group 6.0, Office of the Chancellor and/or Executive Vice President. These Ivey and Stoddard records also cover NYU's educational television development and programming. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series II</span>, Folders 81-82 contain correspondence and press statements regarding the strike of building service employees in February 1958 and that of food service employees in November 1958. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series III</span>, Folders 105-115 cover Brandon's participation as Program Chairman for the Washington, D.C. meeting of the American College Public Relations Association, July 11-13, 1960. </p>

      <p> These records were transferred to the University Archives space in Room 500, 19 University Place from storage in Room SB-4 at Vanderbilt Hall in August 1975. A preliminary review was conducted by Dr. E. Frederick Knauth, Assistant Secretary of the University, in September 1975. These files constitute a portion of Record Group 7.2, Records of the Office Of Vice President for University Relations. The subject files which represent forty-five linear inches of processed material are arranged in three series and are contained in nine manuscript boxes. Each series is arranged alphabetically. Eleven inches of duplicate and published materials were removed. Fifty-three photographs were separated and will be added to the NYU Photo Collection. Four inches of material were discarded. </p>
