    <p>City-As-School is a public high school in the West Village of Manhattan, New York City. The school has been distinguished by its curricular focus on experiential learning through internship, and is built on the idea that all children learn differently, some learn by seeing, some by hearing, others by doing. This collection consists of yearbooks, catalogs, anniversary and graduation ceremony programs, and other City-As-School programming materials. One 1978 softcover yearbook has drawings by Jean-Michel Basquiat on three pages. Basquiat's name is listed in the staff directory for the yearbook, and a photograph of his graffiti tag. Some of the programming materials include a scrapbook documenting City-As-School's "Our Adventure in China" (2002), Remembering Fred Koury: A Tribute and Celebration (2010-09), and City-As-Shakespeare pamphlets. This collection also includes one folder of materials created by City-As-School students and faculty during a visit to the New York University Archives. The digital media consists of graduation slideshows, school education programs regarding anti-bullying and safety, and photographs of school events.</p></div>
