    <p>Born in 1897 in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, George D. Stoddard was active in UNESCO, served on the board of the  Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and was the author of many books on children and education. Stoddard's affiliation with New York University began in 1953 when he was named Chairman of the Directing Committee of the University's $250,000 Self Study. This collection comprises documents that arose from Stoddard's affiliation with New York University. This collection will be of use to researchers interested in education reform and curriculum development and the recent history of NYU. There are a few items of particular note, such as draft copies of Stoddard's proposal for the Gallatin School and the University's Self Study, which Stoddard directed. Copies of Stoddard's Dual Progress Plan are included, along with a large volume of correspondence, notes, and literature relating to it. Also included is Stoddard's 1963 Mission of New York University, which was presented to the Ford Foundation as well as the text of a speech he delivered at NYU's 124th commencement ceremonies in 1956.</p></div>

      <p> Born in 1897 in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, George D. Stoddard was active in UNESCO, served on the board of the  Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and was the author of many books on children and education. Stoddard's affiliation with New York University began in 1953 when he was named Chairman of the Directing Committee of the University's $250,000 Self Study. Before this appointment, Stoddard had been President of the University of Illinois for seven years, Commissioner of Education of the State of New York, President of the University of the State of New York, and Dean of the University of Iowa Graduate School, from which he had received his PhD.  </p><p> In 1956 Stoddard was named Chancellor and Executive Vice President responsible for the educational policy and administration of New York University's schools, colleges, and divisions and also served as Chief Executive Officer in the president's absence. Stoddard retired from this position in 1964, beginning a three-year term as a distinguished professor of education. He later left NYU to become Vice Chancellor of Long Island University. Stoddard left university administration when he retired in 1969 as Chancellor of Long Island University.  </p>
