  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biography of Arthur Lionel Rawlings</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Dr. Arthur Lionel Rawlings is listed as the first curator of the Museum, a position he held from 1956 until his death in 1959. (The Arthur Collection had had specific curators before 1956.)  Before his appointment as curator, Rawlings served as the head of special products at the Bulova Research and Development Labs in Woodside, Queens. A native of England, Rawlings attended university in Birmingham and London and held many patents on gyro-compasses, gyroscopic stabilization, and fire-control devices. He wrote several books, including the then-standard works <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Theory of the Gyro Compass</span> and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Science of Clocks and Watches</span>.  Previous employers included Sperry Gyroscope, Ltd., the Scientific Research Branch of the British Admiralty, and the U.S. Time Corporation.  He also served as president of the Horological Society of New York and was a member of the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors.  </p><p> Dr. Rawlings also gave one of the Arthur-funded lectures on May 15, 1953, on the following topic: "From Hours to Microseconds: Three Centuries of Timekeeping Progress, 1650-1950." </p><p> An obituary for Dr. Rawlings from the Long Island Star-Journal from November 18, 1959, indicates that he passed away after suffering a heart attack while driving on the Van Wyck Expressway on November 17. He was 78.  </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">History of the Watch and Clock Museum</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Per an October 31, 1956, NYU press release, the Watch and Clock Museum was established in that year from the materials in three collections of timepieces then owned by the University. Over half the materials came from the James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches, which had been administered by the University since the 1930s.  </p><p> The Museum was housed in the Gould Memorial Library at NYU's University Heights campus. With over 3,000 timepieces, the Museum was touted as the largest horological collection in the Western Hempisphere at the time of its establishment. </p><p> The Arthur Collection included books and research materials, as well as an endowment for the upkeep of the collection and a periodic lecture series on the topic of "time and its mysteries." The money did not prove sufficient for the upkeep and administration of such a varied and difficult collection (some of the timepieces dated from the 16th century).  Without the proper resources to reassemble the timepieces and without a sufficient display method, when the University Heights campus closed in 1964 and NYU relocated to Greenwich Village the artifacts were placed on permanent loan to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The books from the Arthur Collection were transferred to the University's rare books collection, and the records and photographs of the collection remained with the University Archives.  </p><p> In 1982 New York University decided to dispose of the Arthur Collection, dividing the items between The Smithsonian Institution, the Time Museum at Rockford, and the NAWCC Museum at Columbia, Pennsylvania but has retained the records of the collection.   
In 1985 the Smithsonian transferred the timepieces to the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania. In 2006, six of the timepiecse from the collection were sold at auction.  More information may be found at the museum's website: http://www.nawcc.org/museum/museum.htm. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biography of James Arthur</h3>
  <div>
      <p> James Arthur was born February 26, 1842, in Crosscandley, Ireland. As a boy he studied mechanics and developed an interest in horology. In 1871 he emigrated to New York where in 1885 he founded Arthur and Co., manufacturers of mechanical models for inventors and devices such as differential gears for automobiles. </p><p> Arthur's spare time was spent collecting and designing and making clocks and watches.  In 1925, at the suggestion of his son-in-law, Irving H. Berg, Chaplain of New York University (1919-1936), and later Dean of University College (1936-1941), Arthur presented his collection of 300 clocks, more than 1500 watches and books to New York University. Accompanying the gift was an endowment of $110,000 to support a series of lectures on "time and its mysteries", to keep the collection in a state of repair and to provide for new acquisitions.  Arthur stipulated that none of the income was to be used to pay curators.  </p><p> James Arthur died in Winsted, Connecticut on April 27, 1930. </p><p> For more detailed biographical information see <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography</span>, Volume XXXI, page 232, published by James T. White & Company, New York, 1944.  </p>

  <div>
      <p> This collection consists of records of the curators and University officers related to the administration of the James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches, as well as the lecture series "Time and Its Mysteries." </p><p> The bulk of the materials in this collection date from 1931 to 1963, the year the clocks and watches were sent on permanent loan to the Smithsonian Institution.  The records are incomplete with many gaps.  </p><p> The collection is arranged in three series, and materials are arranged chronologically within each series.  </p><p> This collection will be of value for answering queries about the history and disposition of the James Arthur Collection although it does not contain much information on the specific clocks and watches themselves.  The records are also interesting, as they document the University's venture into maintaining a museum and its eventual decision to discontinue this effort.  </p><p> James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches List of Curators: </p><p> Daniel Webster Hering - first curator; served until his death on March 24, 1938

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Arrangement</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Records of the James Arthur Collection are arranged in three series: Correspondence, and Financial Statements. They are arranged chronologically within the series.  The records include information on the clock and watch collection and on the lecture series, "Time and Its Mysteries".  The arrangement of the materials found in Archives H and in the office of the Dean of Libraries was chronological; papers from these two sources have been interfiled. 
Materials separated from the collection include photographs (see separation sheet) and 28 items (newspaper clippings and Thermofax copies) which were photocopied on acid-free paper.  Additional conservation measures taken were the removal of staples and paper clips and replacement with plastic clips when necessary. </p><p> There is a hint in the correspondence that the initial permanent loan of the collection to the Smithsonian may have eventually involved actual transfer of ownership. </p><p> Joan Grant, January 5, 1985 </p><p> This collection is organized into three series. </p><p> Series 1 contains an excerpt from James Arthur's will donating his collection to the University (see Box 1, Folder 2); correspondence and reports of the curators and University officers related to the administration of both the collection and the series of lectures on "Time and its Mysteries"; minutes of the faculty advisory committee; publicity materials for the collection and lectures; and newspaper clippings. </p><p> The lectures were held annually until the outbreak of World War II. There is a gap in the collection from 1942 until 1946. Thereafter, lectures were held at intervals from two to four years with the most recent one in 1978. New York University Press published the first twelve lectures in a three volume series entitled "Time and Its Mysteries." Materials in the collection related to the lectures often include biographical information on the speakers, printed programs and the texts of the lectures.  A list of the lectures is included in the finding aid.   </p><p> Information on the clock and watch collection can be found in correspondence and reports of the curators. There is no complete inventory of the clocks, but in 1932 Daniel Webster Hering, the first curator, published "The Lure of the Clock," which illustrated and described some items in the original collection. The problems of housing and administering the collection, which are evident throughout the correspondence, finally led to the transfer of the collection to the Smithsonian Institution in September 1963.  Although the collection contains correspondence with a Smithsonian official (see Box 2, Folder 19), the agreement is not in the collection. Box 2, Folder 31 contains a list of clocks that remain at the University.  </p><p> Little information is available on the book collection save a listing of the books in Box 2, Folder 20.  </p><p> A list of the curators is included in the finding aid. </p><p> Series 2 is comprised of financial statements dating from 1941-1961. This series contains reports of income and expenditures from the endowment account.  Reports include information on new acquisitions to the clock collection. </p><p> Series 3 includes reports prepared by curator D.W. Hering and issued by the New York University Bureau of Public Information, with report summaries. This series also includes a checklist of items included in a special exhibition of materials from the clock and watch collection in 1951. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Additional collection information</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The records of the James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches were housed with the "Archives H" collection of the University Archives; no accession data is available.  Several folders of related material (3 inches) were transferred from the office of the Dean of Libraries in December 1984, and incorporated with the records from Archives H. Fifteen feet of material on the Arthur Collection is on deposit at the Smithsonian Institution.  The Arthur book collection remains at the University and is housed in the Special Collections Department of Bobst Library.  Fifty photographs of clocks and some photographs of the curators, originally part of this collection, have been removed to the New York University Archives Photographs Collection.  Although the records cover an extensive time period, 1926-1982, they are not complete. </p>
