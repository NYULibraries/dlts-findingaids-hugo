    <p>The Tisch School of the Arts (TSOA) was founded as a school of performing and media arts in 1965. Alumni include Spike Lee, Oliver Stone, Amy Heckerling, and Ang Lee. Much of the school's history is documented in the correspondence of the School's former Deans, Robert Oppenheim, Robert Corrigan and Theodore Hoffman. Additional records in the collection include annual reports, budgets, financial records, minutes, curricula, scripts and press clippings.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Tish School of the Arts, named for benefactor Lawrence Tisch, has had a long and successful history. The documents in this collection describe its founding in 1965 and subsequent development through 1981. The three men most involved in the school's early history and development were Robert W. Corrigan, Theodore Hoffman, and David J. Oppenheim. Because the collection contains a substantial amount of their correspondence, their biographical sketches are included to provide an introductory background.  </p><p> Robert W. Corrigan was instrumental in the founding of the School of the Arts, making it one of the top fine arts programs in the country. He completed his undergraduate work at Cornell University, received an M.A. (1952) from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. (1955) from the University of Minnesota. </p><p>  Dean Corrigan spent nearly all of his early career as an instructor of dramatic arts, teaching at numerous universities and colleges such as Johns Hopkins, Carleton, Tulane, and the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He joined the NYU faculty in 1964 as a professor of dramatic literature. The following year he was appointed the first dean of the new School of the Arts. Dr. Corrigan left NYU in 1968 to become the President of the California Institute of Fine Arts. </p><p> Theodore Hoffman came to New York University in 1965 to help establish the Theatre Program. A graduate of Columbia University, he was also founder of the Columbia's School of the Arts. Professor Hoffman began his career as an actor and director of Off Broadway theatre. He was also a translator of European drama. In 1958 he was appointed director of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the nation's oldest professional theatre training program. At Carnegie, Dr. Hoffman became a leading spokesperson for the in depth training of theatre artists, including actors, directors, playwrights and designers. He has been Professor Emeritus at NYU since 1989. </p><p> David J. Oppenheim came to New York University in February of 1969 to serve as the second Dean of the School of the Arts. A graduate of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in 1943, Dr. Oppenheim enjoyed an early career as a renowned clarinetist. Before coming to NYU, he worked for years as a producer in the music and television industries. From 1950 to 1959, Dr. Oppenheim served as the director of classical music at Columbia Records. During the early 1960s, he worked first at the American Broadcasting Company and then at the National Broadcasting Company, before producing a number of cultural productions for the Columbia Broadcasting System between 1964 and 1967. In 1968 he became the executive producer of cultural affairs at the Public Broadcasting Laboratory.  </p><p> When Dr. Oppenheim came to NYU, the School of the Arts had only four departments. Under his leadership, the school quadrupled in size. Dr. Oppenheim retired as Dean in 1991 after 22 years with NYU.  </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Tisch School of the Arts collection is divided into five main series, some of which are subdivided. The three principle series titles are: I. Dean Robert W. Corrigan, II. David J. Oppenheim, III. Miscellaneous Reports, IV. Development and V. Administrative Files. While the bulk of the material falls within the Oppenheim series, a significant portion relates to Corrigan's tenure as Dean of the School of the Arts and merits separation from the rest of the material. Chronologically, the Corrigan material is presented first since the series is devoted mainly to the founding of the School of the Arts in 1965, and its early years thereafter. It is divided into five subseries which make up the first two boxes of the collection and the first four folders of box three. Each subseries is arranged chronologically to give a sense of the early development of the School of the Arts. The subseries headings are:  </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">A) Corrigan Correspondence and Papers (box 1, folders 1-23)</span><span class="ead-item">B) Theodore Hoffman Correspondence (box 1, folders 23-25)</span><span class="ead-item">C) Reports/ Bulletins (box 2, folders 6-12)</span><span class="ead-item">D) School Administration (box 2, folders 13-33)</span><span class="ead-item">E) Press Clippings (box 2, folders 34-36)</span><span class="ead-item">F) Nanine Bilski Exams and Writings (box 3, folders 1-4).</span></span> </p><p> The second series of this collection contains information and material relating not only to the Tisch School of the Arts, but also to David J. Oppenheim's career before coming to NYU. Indeed, this material comprises the bulk of the collection and dates as far back as 1956. It is included here because it was in the possession of Oppenheim while he was affiliated with NYU. It also supplies information on his extensive work with the performing arts before replacing Corrigan in 1969. </p><p> This series is divided into three major subseries, each of which covers a significant part of Oppenheim's career, before and during his tenure at NYU. These divisions are: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">A) Career at CBS (boxes 3-5, and the first 19 folders of box 6)</span><span class="ead-item">B) Career at the Public Broadcasting Laboratory (PBL)(folders 20-29 of box six and box 7, folders 1-25)</span><span class="ead-item">C) Early Career at NYU (folders 24-27 of box 7, and folders 1-5 of box 8)</span></span> </p><p> It should be pointed out that the Oppenheim papers covering the years between his arrival at NYU and the 1981 sesquicentennial are contained in the larger part of the main collection that had a preexisting arrangement prior to being accessioned. </p><p> Each subseries is further divided along lines similar to the divisions made in Series I: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item"> A) Subseries A, for example, begins with Oppenheim's general correspondence while at CBS (box 3, folders 5-14).</span><span class="ead-item"> B) The next subseries comes under Research/Programming (box 3, folders 15-36; and box 4, folders 1-19), which provides information on the background work and research Oppenheim oversaw on his productions while at CBS. The broadcasts for which there is such information include "Casals at 88," Oppenheim's show on Igor Stravinsky, and "Pop Life: The Rock Revolution." </span><span class="ead-item"> C) Following the background series is a subseries made up of old scripts and transcripts(box 4, folders 20-26; all of box 5; and box 6, folders 1-6) dating as far back as 1956. Most are scripts from the Hallmark Hall of Fame productions. It is not clear if Oppenheim actually had anything to do with these productions, but these scripts were in his possession. Also included here are transcripts from his Stravinsky and "Pop Life" productions, among others.</span><span class="ead-item"> D) The fourth subseries(box 6, folders 7-9) covers administrative issues at CBS.</span><span class="ead-item"> E) The Reports/Conferences subseries covers issues relating to television and broadcasting (box 6, folders 10-12).</span><span class="ead-item"> F) The next subseries consists of promotional material for the "Play of the Week" broadcasts (box 6, folders 13-17).</span><span class="ead-item"> G) Press Clippings, most of which are reviews of different Oppenheim broadcasts (box 6, folders 18-19).</span></span> </p><p> Subseries B is divided in the following manner: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">A) General Correspondence at the Public Broadcasting Laboratory (box 6, folders 20-29).</span><span class="ead-item">B) Research and Programming (box 7, folders 1-18). Included here is background information on a number of programs produced by Oppenheim, including his Jean-Luc Godard special, the Buffalo Arts Festival, and the Living Theatre.</span><span class="ead-item">C) Scripts and Transcripts (box 7, folders 19-21).</span><span class="ead-item">D) Public Broadcasting Laboratory Administration (box 7, folders 22-23).</span></span> </p><p> Subseries C, the smallest of the three, is divided in this way: </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">A) Early NYU Correspondence (box 7, folders 24-25).</span><span class="ead-item">B) Early NYU Administration (box 7, folders 26-27).</span><span class="ead-item">C) NYU Sesquicentennial (box 8, folders 1-5). </span></span> </p><p> The reports in the final series are separate because it is unclear how they fit in to either of the deans' tenures at the School of the Arts </p><p> Miscellaneous Reports is the smallest of the five series and was created because the original collection contained a number of documents whose relevance to the Tisch School could not easily be deciphered. The series, which is mostly made up of reports and research projects pertaining to the performing arts, comprise almost all of box 8 in this collection. It includes Ford Foundation reports, a paper on the history of African theater, and writings by Donald Shoulty. </p><p> A later accession, 93-025, was added to the collection. Series IV, Development and Series V, Administrative Files are included in this accession. Series V is the largest of the five series. </p>

      <p> The material contained in this collection came to the New York University Archives as part of accession 93-025 on August 30, 1993 from the Tisch School of the Arts located at 721 Broadway. The entire collection from the files of TSOA Dean David J. Oppenheim contained 110 linear feet of files, photographs, films, books, audio tapes, and promotional information primarily from the years 1965 to 1981. Most of the collection arrived boxed and arranged in some order. The material listed here, however, was found in some disarray on the floor of a closet and had to be put back in order. Originally, the material measured 20 linear feet; after processing, which included the separation of a great number of books and photographs, the collection comprises ten linear feet of material. </p>
