  <div>
      <p> The Leonard N. Stern School of Business was founded in 1900 by Charles Waldo Haskins as the New York University (NYU) Undergraduate School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance at NYU's Washington Square Campus.  The graduate business program was launched in 1916. Located in New York's downtown business district, it offered both full-time and part-time professional degree programs. </p><p> The School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance was renamed the College of Business and Public Administration and merged with the Graduate School of Business and Public Administration in 1972. The same year, the school's Tisch Hall opened to house the undergraduate college.  </p><p> In 1988 NYU Business School alumnus Leonard Stern donated $30 million. The school was renamed the Leonard N. Stern School of Business (Stern School of Business) in his honor. The gift allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities to NYU's Washington Square campus. The Kaufman Management Center later opened in 1992 as a state-of-the-art facility for the Stern School.  </p>
