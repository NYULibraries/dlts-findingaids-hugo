  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Penumbra Foundation was founded in 1998 in New York City. It is a photographic arts organization developed to maintain relevant historical and analog photography in the digital age through education, supporting artists' work in historical processes, lecture series, research, residency programs, workshops, and studio and library programs in collaboration with a like-minded community. </p><p> Eric Taubman, co-founder of the Penumbra Foundation, is a fine art photographer and businessman who developed and operated photo labs in New York City and around the world for 30 years. At the time that digital photography was supplanting traditional analog services Eric turned his attention to the Center for Alternative Photography (CAP), a workshop based organization, which later would turn into the Penumbra Foundation, a non-profit 501c3 dedicated to supporting a broad range of historical and analog practices. His passion is the history of photography in all of its forms, processes, art, historical equipment and primary source material. His collection of photographic manuals is unique and comprised of early and rare volumes. Some of these items were owned by well-known photographers of the day. </p><p> The Penumbra Collection is complimented by a comprehensive and rare collection of lens manuals and lens catalogs. Geoffrey H. Berliner is the Executive Director of the Penumbra Foundation, a practicing photographer, a well-known portraitist, and a historian of photography.  He has an extensive collection of historical lenses, said to be the largest collection in the world and an equally comprehensive collection of lens manuals. This ephemera is often discarded so the lens catalog collection may well represent the last copy left. </p>
