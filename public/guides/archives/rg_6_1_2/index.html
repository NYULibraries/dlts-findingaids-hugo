    <p>The collection is made up of the records of C. Duncan Rice created during his tenure as Vice Chancellor of New York University, dating between 1991 and 1996.  These records pertain to the administration of the university during that period, with particular emphasis on global initiatives, in line with President L. Jay Oliva's vision of NYU as a fully internationalized university.  Many of the materials relate to Rice's efforts to bring internationally-prominent scholars and public figures to the university through such efforts as the International Visitors Program.  

Rice had also served as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at NYU from 1985-1994. He stepped down from the Dean's position to devote his full efforts to the Vice Chancellorship in 1994.  In 1996, Rice left NYU to assume the post of Principal at his alma mater, the University of Aberdeen.</p></div>

  <div>
      <p> C. Duncan Rice was Vice Chancellor at NYU from 1991 until 1996.  He was preceded in the office by Debra James.  Rice had also served as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at NYU from 1985-1994, when he stepped down from the Dean's position to devote his full efforts to the Vice Chancellorship.  As Vice Chancellor, Rice led NYU's global initiatives, part of President L. Jay Oliva's vision of NYU as a fully internationalized university.*
  
Rice left NYU in 1996 to assume the post of Principal at his alma mater, the University of Aberdeen.  He was knighted in 2009 for his services to higher education.  The Sir Duncan Rice Library at the University of Aberdeen, opened in 2012, is named for him. </p><p> Sources: </p><p> 1. Archives Bio file, C.

  <div>
      <p> The collection is made up of the records of C. Duncan Rice created during his tenure as Vice Chancellor of New York University, dating between 1991 and 1996.  These records pertain to the administration of the university during that period, with particular emphasis on global initiatives, in line with President L. Jay Oliva's vision of NYU as a fully internationalized university.  Many of the materials relate to Rice's efforts to bring internationally-prominent scholars and public figures to the university through such efforts as the International Visitors Program.   </p><p> Other materials in the collection relate to major donations to the university, relations with individual donors and larger foundations, and the NYU Society of Fellows.  Some correspondence provides documentation of John Brademas' activities as President Emeritus.  One folder, labeled "Carnegie," contains materials dating from 1988-1991, at which time Rice served only as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science.  The materials in that folder, however, relate to the previous folder of correspondence between L. Jay Oliva and John Brademas and various representatives of the Carnegie Foundation.   </p>
