As a professor Wrong taught at the University of Nevada at Reno, the University of Toronto, The New School, Brown University, and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, but spent the bulk of his academic career at NYU. This collection consists of materials created and collected by  Wrong in the course of his personal and professional life, including personal correspondence, outlines for original writings, conference notes, autobiographical essays (including one later published in <span class="ead-title">Authors and Their Lives</span>), and his Ph.D. dissertation from Columbia University.

The collection also contains books and academic journals written or collected by Wrong, many of which have been annotated. The materials document the teaching of sociology at NYU, the department's separation from anthropology, and the larger discussions in the discipline concerning quantitative reasoning and analysis.</p></div>

      <p> Dennis Wrong (1923- ) is a Canadian sociologist and emeritus professor of sociology in the New York University Department of Sociology. As a professor Wrong taught at the University of Nevada at Reno, the University of Toronto, The New School, Brown University, and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, but spent the bulk of his academic career at NYU. Wrong is the author of several books and articles, and has been involved in the editorial boards of numerous publications, including the <span class="ead-title">New York Review of Books</span>, <span class="ead-title">Dissent</span>, <span class="ead-title">Commentary</span>, and <span class="ead-title">Partisan Review</span>. Wrong was at the center of the debates among leading intellectuals from the 1950s-1980s that concerned McCarthyism and the Cold War. He was also a prominent voice during the 1980s-1990s in the discussions surrounding the emergence of the Neoconservatives. The Dennis Wrong Award is given for the best graduate paper of the year by the NYU Department of Sociology. </p>
