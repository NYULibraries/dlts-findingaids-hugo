  <div>
      <p> The Office of Radio and Television was created in 1952 to oversee the development of University-sponsored and -produced radio and television programs. In addition to producing educational programs, the Office of Radio and Television advised NYU faculty members on developing their prospective programs. The office also acted as a liaison between NYU and the media. </p><p> Between 1957 and 1980, the Office of Radio and Television underwent several changes of administrative jurisdiction. On April 22, 1957, the Board of Trustees amended the New York University By-Laws to create the Office of Vice President for University Relations. In 1957, the Office of Radio and Television was one of several functions placed under the jurisdiction of the Vice President for University Relations. The director of the Office of Radio and Television, Warren A. Kraetzer, became one of the vice president's assistants. Ralph Rourke served as assistant to the director of the Office of Radio and Television from 1957-1965. In 1960, Thomas J. Brophy succeeded Kraetzer as Director of Radio and Television.  </p><p> The decade from 1965-1975 saw increased administrative influence over radio and television activities. In 1965, the administrative jurisdiction of the office along with other public relations functions was transferred to the office of the Vice President for University Development, and the post of Director of Public Relations was created. The Director supervised radio and television productions and reported to the Vice President of University Development. Although the News Bureau, which included radio and television functions, was under the supervision of the Director of Public Relations, it is unclear if the News Bureau manager, Paul T. Herte, had any control over the Office of Radio and Television. </p><p> As a result of these administrative changes, the position of Director of Radio and Television disappeared, and Thomas Brophy became the assistant manager for the Office of Radio and Television. Ralph Rourke's title changed to producer/writer. </p><p> In the 1970s, the educational and public relations functions of the Radio and Television Office were divided. Brophy became "Sunrise Semester" producer, and Rourke became assistant manager for the new Bureau of Radio and Television, promoting NYU to the media, and arranging radio and television appearances for faculty and administrators. </p><p> The Office of Radio and Television underwent a third transfer of administrative jurisdiction in 1975 when a new Senior Vice President for External Affairs was appointed. His responsibilities included supervising the director of public affairs, who oversaw all public relations activities, including radio and television.  </p><p> From 1975-1980 it is uncertain whether public affairs activities were supervised by a vice president, director or both. In 1975, Michael Blumenfeld is referred to as both "Director of Public Affairs" and "Vice President of Public Affairs." </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Series I consists of the correspondence files of Ralph Rourke, Associate Manager for Broadcasting between 1968 and 1982. Arranged chronologically, it encompasses the period between 1968 and 1982. These files also include materials describing programs, public relations activities, lectures, ceremonies, and other related topics. The focus of these records is on the public face of the University and project maintenance. They also include scripts, reports and files related to inquiries and solicitations. </p><p> Series II contains of general subject files of the Office of Radio and Television dating from 1953 to 1980. Materials in subseries A, B and C pertain to the management of specific television and radio shows. They include materials on research, public relations, arrangement with hosts and guests, recording schedules, memos, scripts, program outlines, news clippings, and press releases. Included in these documented programs is the NYU lecture series and the Arthur K. Salomon lecture, which broadcast speeches by prominent individuals made on the NYU campus. Many of the educational programs and talk shows emphasized an urban theme in keeping with the University's emphasis on building a positive public image as an exciting urban campus. These subseries illustrate both the educational and public relations functions of radio and television at New York University and reflect program management activities as well as administrative functions of the office. Subseries D contains files from the NYU Office of Public Affairs, of which the Office of Radio of Television is part, from 1976-1982. They are subject files arranged in chronological order. The subseries consists of correspondence, memos, press releases, drawing and diagrams, maps and charts, plans and blueprints. It deals with the administrative and functional aspects of the NYU Office of Public Affairs.  </p>
