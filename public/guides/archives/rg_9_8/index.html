    <p>Founded in 1969, the Institute of African American Affairs (IAAA) at New York University's mission is to research, document, and celebrate the cultural and intellectual production of Africa and its diaspora in the Atlantic world and beyond with a commitment to the study of Blacks in modernity through concentrations in Pan-Africanism and Black Urban Studies. The Records of the Institute of African American Affairs date from 1963 to the early 2000s. Included in these records are conference and event materials in paper and computer files, and audiovisual recordings of these events. Events with a significant amount of material in the collection include the Black Male Conference; Black Theater Forum; the Artists and Scholars-in-Residence program; Black Genius; the Yari Yari conference for Black women writers; and the Slave Routes: The Long Memory Symposium. These records also contain material related to the files of various IAAA Directors, including Founding Director Roscoe C. Brown Jr., Edward M. Carroll, Earl S. Davis,  and Manthia Diawara. Files related to the Association of Education in Journalism internship program, which was co-founded by Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. can also be found in this collection.  Audio recordings of the radio talk shows <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Soul of Reason</span> from the 1970s and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Urban League Presents</span> from the 1960s, as well as May 1965 recordings of an NYU Teach-In, which was organized in protest of the Vietnam War are in this collection.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Institute of African American Affairs (IAAA) at New York University, which was initially called Institute of Afro-American Affairs, was founded in 1969 to research, document, and celebrate the cultural and intellectual production of Africa and its diaspora in the Atlantic world and beyond. The New York University Senate created the IAAA to coordinate the university-wide academic and service activities focusing on cultural programs for NYU's Black students, faculty, staff, and larger New York community. 
<br>
<br>
The IAAA is affiliated and shares leadership, staff, and facilities with NYU's African Studies Program. Both organizations are committed to the study of Blacks in modernity through concentrations in Pan-Africanism and Black Urban Studies. The Institute also founded the first statewide organization of scholars in the field (The New York State Black Studies Conference) and played a pivotal role in the creation of the NYU Association of Black Faculty and Administrators. 
<br>
<br>
Along with many programs, panels, and conferences, the IAAA also each year hosts Artists and Scholars-in-Residence, who during their residencies participate in seminars, offer public presentations of their work, and meet with students. Past Artists-in-Residence have included author Walter Mosley; poet and essayist Amiri Baraka; actor, playwright, and performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; poet Jayne Cortez; actor and producer Danny Glover; and Malian musician Salif Keita. Scholars-in-Residence have included Nigerian author and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka; and David Levering Lewis, MacArthur Fellow and Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of History at Rutgers.

  <div>
      <p> The Records of the Institute of African American Affairs (IAAA) date from 1963 to the early 2000s with a large portion of the collection consisting of material related to the planning and promotion of IAAA conferences and events, in the form of paper files, computer files,  and audiovisual recordings. Events with a significant amount of material in the collection include the Black Male Conference; Black Theater Forum; the Artists and Scholars-in-Residence program; Black Genius; the Yari Yari conference for Black women writers; and the Slave Routes: The Long Memory Symposium. A small amount of work files for the IAAA publication <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Black Renaissance Noire</span> are in this collection, dating from 1992 to 2004.
<br>
<br>
Files created by IAAA Founding Director Roscoe C. Brown Jr., Acting Director Edward M. Carroll, Earl S. Davis,  and Manthia Diawara date from the 1960s to the early 2000s. These files typically contain meeting minutes, correspondence, and research related to the IAAA. Internship program files dating from the 1970s to the 1990s in this collection relate to the Association of Education in Journalism, which was co-founded by Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr.
<br>
<br>
The collection also contains 266 recordings of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Soul of Reason</span>, a radio talk show that aired between 1971 and 1986, with interviewees which included politicians, professional athletes, medical professionals, and contemporary artists. Audio recordings of another radio talk show, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Urban League Presents</span> can also be found in this collection. These recordings date from 1963 to 1973 and cover a wide range of topics impacting the Black American community.  Audio recordings in this collection from May 1965 highlight an NYU Teach-In which had been organized as a protest against the Vietnam War. Founding IAAA Director Dr. Roscoe C. Brown Jr. was a speaker at the event. </p>

  <div>
      <p> Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2018 are not yet recorded.
<br>
<br>
In 2020, unprocessed paper material was rehoused in new acid-free folders and boxes, kept in their original order, and inventoried at the folder level. Unprocessed audiovisual material was labeled with unique numbers, grouped by format, placed in appropriately sized boxes, and inventoried to the item level in chronological order. In the finding aid, the unprocessed material file titles were added onto the end of existing inventories for some series, while new series and subseries were also created for new material. Select creator-supplied titles containing racist and ableist language were identified in this collection, but have been retained to convey important contextual information regarding time and place in which the documents and titles were created. Additional processing notes were added at the series and subseries level where these titles are listed.
<br>
<br>
Previously processed paper material was refoldered and reboxed when necessary, and all file-level barcode notes were removed from the inventory. 
<br>
<br>
New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. Data CDs, DVDs, and floppy computer disks were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. Sixty digital objects were created and added into the collection inventory to repressent the over 5,000 computer files.
<br>
<br>
Series-level dates, extents, and scope and content notes were added to the finding aid. </p>
