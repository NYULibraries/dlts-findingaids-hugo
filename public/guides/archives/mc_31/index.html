      <p> Charles Henry Ludlum was born in Jamaica, New York, on February 21, 1843. He attended New York University (then the University of the City of New York) College of Arts and Pure Science from 1859-1863 and graduated with an A.B. in 1863. He attended New York University Medical College from 1863-1865 and received his M.D. in 1865. He received his A.M. degree from NYU in 1866. Ludlum was an intern at Bellevue Hospital from 1865-1867, and a visiting physician O.D.D. from 1867-1874. A practicing physician in Boonton, New Jersey, from 1874-1878, he moved his practice to Hempstead, New York, where he spent the remainder of his life. In 1889 Ludlum became a member of the Board of Education of Hempstead and became its president in 1890. He was married to Mary Jane White on May 20, 1868, and had six children.  </p><p> Ezekiel Deyo Van Dyck was born in New Paltz, New York, on February 15, 1858.

Muhlenberg, while at the same time teaching Greek at St. Paul's College, Flushing, Long Island (1843-1846), of which Muhlenberg was headmaster. He was ordained deacon in 1845 and priest in 1846, and was Muhlenberg's curate at the Church of the Holy Communion in New York until 1847.

The parish was organized February 12, 1849, as the Church of the Transfiguration in the City of New York. From 1850-1862, Houghton was also a professor of Hebrew in the General Theological Seminary, New York City. During the Civil War he harbored slaves on their way to the Canadian border, established a war hospital, and during the Draft Riots of 1863 he sheltered hundreds of children driven by a mob from the Colored Orphan Asylum. Houghton's Church of the Transfiguration achieved lasting fame as "the little church around the corner." </p><p> William Frank Burroughs received his A.B. degree from New York University in 1859. He died in 1899. </p><p> John Henry MacCracken was born in Rochester, Vermont, on September 30, 1875.

In 1858 he founded the Botanical Club of New York, which later became known as the Torrey Botanical Club. During his illustrious career he held several professorial posts beginning at the West Point Military Academy from 1824-1827. In 1832, Torrey arrived at New York University as a professor of chemistry and botany. Later in his life, Torrey served as an Assayer for the United States Mint. </p><p> Howard Crosby was born in New York City in 1826. Crosby, after graduating from New York University in 1844, became a Professor of Greek at NYU. After NYU Crosby taught at Rutgers College in New Jersey and in 1863 became pastor of the Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Crosby returned to NYU and became its fourth chancellor in 1870 and maintained his pastorship during that time. The eleven years of his administration (1870-1881) marked a period of financial uncertainty and little growth. During his career he published several notable religious works including "The Lands of the Moslem" (1851), "Bible Companion" (1870), "Jesus: His Life and Works" (1871), and "True Temperance Reform" (1879). </p>

      <p> Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2018 are unknown. Because this is an assembled collection, University Archives and ACM staff made the decision in 2019 to unify this collection under one call phrase, MC 31. The individual collection numbers, MC 31-37 and MC 39-40, have been changed to series one through nine (I = MC 31, II = MC 32, III = MC 33, IV = MC 34, V = MC 35, VI = MC 36, VII = MC 37, VIII = MC 39, IX = MC 40). Materials were rehoused in four manuscript boxes and folder numbers were changed accordingly. </p>
