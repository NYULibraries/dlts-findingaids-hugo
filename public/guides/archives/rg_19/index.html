  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Beginning in 1947 and ending in 1962, Thomas Clark Pollock served as Dean of Washington Square College. William Earl Buckler succeeded Pollock in 1962 and remained in that position until 1969. In that year, Richard Bayly Winder became Dean of Washington Square College; he presided until 1971. Phillip Mayerson, who had served as Vice Dean of Washington Square College from 1969 to 1971, became the Acting Dean from 1971 to 1973. In 1973 he became Dean of Washington Square and University College (formed when the University College of Arts and Science merged with the Washington Square College following the sale of the University Heights campus). Mayerson served in that capacity until 1978. </p><p> The Dean of Washington Square College served a variety of functions within the University's administration, including oversight of the development of curricula in various departments and serving as a liaison between administration and students. These functions and others are reflected within the collection. </p><p> Under the administrations of Buckler and Winder, the major purpose of the Dean's office involved helping Washington Square College live up to its potential as an undergraduate college in a large and complex University located in an equally large and complex city.  </p><p> Under Mayerson, the Dean's office broadened its outlook. He added fundraising as a major function of his office, in addition to attracting and holding students. Mayerson did everything in his power to bring larger enrollment numbers into Washington Square College. He concentrated on personalizing the admissions process, helping the students to mix more with the faculty, cutting red tape in dealing with the problems of individual students, and created a closer relationship between his office and that of the Director of Admissions. These initiatives are well documented in this collection. </p>

The records of Series II were most likely transferred to the Archives in 1981 by then-Dean Jill N. Claster. </p>
