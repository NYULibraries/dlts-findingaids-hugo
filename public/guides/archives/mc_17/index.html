After a year in the United States, he was appointed to a Fellowship in Physics at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.  He was awarded the Ph.D. in 1896 as a result of study and research at Clark.   </p><p> Following conferral of his degree, Edmondson was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at NYU's University College, located on the Heights campus in the Bronx.
