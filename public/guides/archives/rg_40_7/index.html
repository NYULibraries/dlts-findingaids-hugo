  <div>
      <p> The Alumni Federation of New York University was incorporated in 1921. Officially, the Alumni Federation united what had previously been separate alumni groups from the different schools and colleges of the University.  Prior to the formation of the Alumni Federation, the General Alumni Association existed but with little or no mandate to coordinate the administration of alumni activities.  The Alumni Federation Board of Governors was organized with 21 members from the different alumni groups, with the largest schools contributing the most representatives.  By 1940, amendments to the Alumni Federation constitution replaced the Board of Governors with a Board of Directors and increased its membership. Representatives to the Board were chosen based on a "Class" system, where larger associations, in Class A, contributed more representatives and had more power on the Board than Classes B and C.  </p><p> The Alumni Federation oversaw the involvement of alumni within the University, hosted events and activities, and administered the Alumni Fund. Awards and honors like the Great Teachers Award were given out by the Alumni Federation to individuals for their achievements and contributions to the University. The Alumni Federation also published newsletters and magazines like the <span class="ead-title">Alumnus</span>. </p><p> In the 1980s, the relationship of the Alumni Federation and the University became strained. The University desired to have more control over the Federation's fundraising efforts, especially in engaging with younger alumni and connecting with alumni outside of the New York metropolitan area. The University requested, after a special review, that the Alumni Federation staff director report to the President of the University in addition to the Federation's Board of Directors. This request was made to justify the $2.7 million in annual assistance the University gave the Federation. In January of 1985, the Alumni Federation decided to become an operationally independent organization and by that autumn, it was no longer recognized and its activities no longer endorsed by the University. </p><p> By 1995, the Alumni Federation had been significantly restructured and was mainly administered by alumni from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The last Board of Directors minutes in the collection date from June 22, 1995. </p>
