  <div>
      <p> In September 1977, NYU and Manhattanville College (Purchase, NY) began offering joint master's programs in NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) and Graduate School of Business Administration (GSBA). The programs were designed for part-time students with family and/or work responsibilities and to enable currently employed professionals to further their education and increase their knowledge in their specific field. Programs lasted two to three years, and NYU conferred the degrees and controlled the curriculum. Classes were initially taught by NYU faculty, but gradually, select Manhattanville professors taught introductory courses. Courses were offered at both NYU and Manhattanville campuses.  </p><p> Manhattanville sought to overcome inflation issues and decreasing enrollment through inter-institutional cooperation with NYU. On April 29, 1977, the New York Board of Regents voted to amend NYU's charter and master plan authorizing establishment of a program in general management at Manhattanville leading to a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). In June 1977 the Board approved the remaining joint master's programs programs. GSAS offered a Master of Arts in Music and Psychology and an Master of Science in Biology, Chemistry (Organic or Physical), Computer Science, and Mathematics. GSBA offered an MBA program. In 1978, a graduate program in journalism began. NYU's School of Education, Health, Nursing, and Arts Professions (SEHNAP) also offered graduate credit courses from The Center for Safety, as well as courses on early childhood and elementary education, educational administration and supervision, home economics and nutrition, and leisure studies. The School of Continuing Education (SCE) offered 12 non-credit courses from the division of Career and Professional Development in publicity, personnel, communications, finance, data processing and systems analysis, and real estate.  </p><p> The first student to complete a joint NYU/Manhattanville program graduated in June 1979. The programs signified the first time NYU's GSAS and GSBA offered degrees at another college and the first time Manhattanville awarded degrees other than its own.  </p>
