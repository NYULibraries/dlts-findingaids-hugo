  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biography of Harold Oliver Voorhis</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Harold Oliver Voorhis (1896-1985) served as the first Secretary of New York University (NYU). Born on July 29, 1896, in Kokomo, Indiana, Voorhis received his B.S. from Colgate University in 1919. In 1920 he studied at Columbia University Law School and in 1922 earned an M.A. in Economics from New York University. In 1945 he was awarded an honorary LL.D. from Colgate University. </p><p> From 1914 to 1915 Voorhis worked as a surveyor's assistant in Saskatchewan, Canada. From 1916 to 1919 he served as the secretary to the President of Colgate University, and he also served as secretary to the Chautauqua Institution in 1919. In 1920 Voorhis moved to New York City and took a position as secretary to the Vice President of the National Bank of Commerce. Voorhis began his administrative career at New York University as executive secretary to Chancellor Elmer Ellsworth Brown. Voorhis also taught economics at NYU during this time period.  </p><p> During Voorhis' tenure the Secretary served as the Chancellor's principal assistant. Voorhis served in six administrations: Elmer Ellsworth Brown (1911-1933), Harry Woodburn Chase (1933-51), James Loomis Madden (acting Chancellor from 1951-1952), Henry Townley Heald (1952-1956), Carroll Vincent Newsom (1956-1962), and James McNaughton Hester (1962-1975). </p><p> The University grew tremendously during this time period, and the scope of responsibilities of the office of the Secretary reflected this growth. In 1945 Voorhis became the Vice Chancellor and Secretary under Chancellor Harry Woodburn Chase. In 1955 he was named Vice President and Secretary during Henry T. Heald's presidency. Over time the office supervised a wide array of functions, including serving as Clerk of the Council/Trustees and Secretary of the Senate. The office also handled the planning of public ceremonies, including commencement, and oversaw various other offices, including the Bureau of Public Information, the Student Activities Office, the New York University Press, ROTC, and the New York University Art Collection.  </p><p> Voorhis retired in 1962 after 42 years of service to New York University.  </p><p> Sources:  </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">"Voorhis Retires," <span class="ead-title">Washington Square Journal</span>, December 1961, Vol. 7, No. 35.</span><span class="ead-item">Still, Bayrd, "Evolution of Organization of General Administrative Offices, 1880-1978," (1978).

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">History of the Office of Vice President and Secretary at New York University</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Office of Vice President and Secretary at New York University (NYU) was first created as the Office of the Secretary of the University in 1925. The Secretary was appointed by the Council, upon recommendation of the Chancellor, and served as the general executive assistant to the Chancellor. The Office of Secretary became central to the administration of the University. </p><p> The primary function of the Secretary was to assist the Chancellor in the discharge of his duties. The responsibilities delineated in 1925 included: conducting correspondence with individuals and institutions relating to the University at large; coordinating the work of secretaries of the several schools and divisions; preparing and maintaining minutes, documentary materials, records, and conducting correspondence of the Council and its committees. The Secretary affixed the University seal and maintained records of diplomas and certificates issued by the University.  He maintained personnel records of the faculty, published the University bibliography, supervised the publication of annual reports, and performed other administrative duties assigned by the Chancellor. </p><p> The responsibilities of the Secretary increased in volume as the University grew. In recognition of the importance of the Secretary, the administrative title of the office was changed on July 1, 1945, to Vice Chancellor and Secretary in accordance with the duties assigned to the office by Chancellor Harry Woodburn Chase and the University Council. The title was changed again in 1955 to Vice President and Secretary as a result of a general administrative reorganization under President Henry T. Heald. Several assistants to the Secretary were hired in 1956.  </p>

  <div>
      <p> This collection reflects Harold Voorhis' tenure as Secretary (1925-1945), Vice Chancellor and Secretary (1945-1956), and Vice President and Secretary (1956-1962) of New York University (NYU). The materials consist of correspondence, memoranda, committee minutes, reports, printed material, charts, blueprints, petitions, press releases, speeches and photographs. The records reflect the growth, diversity, and complexity of NYU, the development of higher education as a whole, and the reactions and adjustments of a major, private urban university to the changing social concerns during these several decades. They provide information concerning the University's response to the Depression, World War II and the post-war years, the McCarthy Era, student activism, and many other social, political, economic, and academic issues. Correspondents include: Philip Badger, James Gordon Bennett, Elmer Ellsworth Brown, Marshall Stewart Brown, Harry Woodburn Chase, Walter Wheeler Cook, Frank L. Howley, Theodore Francis Jones, LeRoy Elwood Kimball, Otto Nathan, William Francklyn Paris, Rufus Daniel Smith, and Leslie Jay Tompkins. </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series I: Administrative Correspondence and Subject Files</span> </p><p> The administrative correspondence and subject files of the Office of Vice President and Secretary are arranged in one alphabetical subject series filed according to name or primary subject heading.

Statistics recorded include: positions of faculty and administration, volumes in the library, average salaries by department and rank and detailed data on physical plant space usage and facilities.  </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series III: Law Center Campaign</span>  </p><p> This series contains minutes, reports, financial statements, correspondence, petitions, press releases, speeches, photographs, printed material and memorabilia concerning the Law Center Foundation and Campaign (1944-1951). </p><p> <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-bold">Series IV: Medical Center Campaign</span> </p><p> This series consists of 2.25 feet of material pertaining to the New York University Bellevue Medical Center Campaign.
