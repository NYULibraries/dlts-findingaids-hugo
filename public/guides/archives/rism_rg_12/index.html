    <p>The Study of Chronic Marihuana Users in Jamaica (The Ganja Project) is a collection of materials relating to an anthropological and medical study of the long-term effects of cannabis smoking. It was commissioned by the National Institute of Mental Health in 1970 and conducted by the Research Institute for the Study of Man, in collaboration with the University of the West Indies, between 1970 and 1972. Materials include human subject data, background research on the physiological and psychological effects of cannabis use, the legal issues surrounding research involving controlled substances, and published materials relating to the study.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">History of the Study of Chronic Marihuana Users in Jamaica (The Ganja Project)</h3>
  <div>
    
      <p> The Study of Chronic Marihuana Users in Jamaica was initiated at the invitation of the Center for Studies of Narcotic and Drug Abuse of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and carried out by the Research Institute for the Study of Man (RISM) in collaboration with the Faculty of Medicine at the University of the West Indies (UWI). The research program was designed to provide data on the clinical and social effects of chronic cannabis smoking in Jamaica, the first study to be undertaken in a natural as well as laboratory setting. 
 
Preparation for the study involved negotiation with several agencies within the Government of Jamaica, which at the time prohibited the cultivation, use and possession of cannabis. Discussions with authorities in the Jamaican government and the University of the West Indies resulted in full support for the project. Agreements were made for the protection and privacy of field workers, informants, subjects and staff, and arrangements were made for facilities to conduct clinical studies of long-term effects of smoking cannabis. 
 
Combining anthropological and medical research methodology, the study began in June 1970 with anthropological field studies which were conducted over the first 18 months. Sixty volunteer subjects were selected from these communities and admitted to the University Hospital in November 1970. Thirty marijuana users with a history of at least ten years of past use, and 30 non-smokers, underwent medical and psychological examinations over a period of six days. Anthropological and clinical data analysis was completed in February 1972, and findings were reported to the NIMH and the Jamaican Government in March of the same year.
 
Controversy surrounded publication of the results of the study. They did not confirm existing research concerning negative consequences derived from the use of cannabis, most particularly the "anti-motivational" aspect often associated with the use of the substance. 
 
In 1973, a Conference on Cross Cultural Perspectives on Cannabis was held in Chicago preceding the IXth International Congress of the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences. Supported by the NIMH, the conference was attended by over sixty scientists involved in various aspects of research on the complexities of cannabis in relation to man and culture, representing the fields of anthropology, botany, genetics, pharmacology, psychiatry and sociology. The proceedings, edited by Vera Rubin, were published as Cannabis and Culture in 1975. </p><p> References

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content Note</h3>
  <div>
    
      <p> The bulk of the collection consists of human subject data from medical analyses conducted in 1970. There exists a substantial amount of background research material for the study relating to existing research on the effects of cannabis smoking and other drug use. Other background research includes an assessment of the legal status of marihuana use in Jamaica, which was produced for the study, and materials examining the legal issues related to clinical studies involving illegal substances. This research includes pamphlets from groups such as NORML and nearly two years of issues of <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The U.S. Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence</span>. Also included are press clippings, book reviews, magazines, and journals with content relating to the published results of the Study of Chronic Marihuana Users in Jamaica, as well as the final report as issued to the National Institute of Mental Health. Data from the ethnographic study of Jamaican communities are not part of The Ganja Project collection. </p>
