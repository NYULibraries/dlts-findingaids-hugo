    <p>The John G. Mason Collection contain various records from many of the student and student faculty organizations active at NYU during the years 1962 to 1978. The primary focus of this collection is student and faculty opposition to the Vietnam War between the years 1965 and 1971. The records include organizational position papers, flyers, and posters. These materials are a representative sample of information on student activity and do not contain comprehensive documentation of all student groups.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biographical Note</h3>
  <div>
      <p> A member of the interdepartmental Albert Schweitzer Program in the Humanities for undergraduates at New York University, John G. Mason was active in the Students for a Democratic Society and other university student organizations of the 1960s-1970s. Like many other students of the period, Mason was involved in organizations which were funded and/or organized by the university, and also in organizations which were external to the university and self-funded. </p><p> Mason was strongly affected by his matriculation in the Schweitzer Program, which was established by New York State in 1965 and given an endowed chair. The Schweitzer Program was led by Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien from 1965-1969. Dr. O'Brien, a Left-opposition politician in the Republic of Ireland (Eire), and a longtime contributing editor to the <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, had a significant intellectual influence upon Mason and other members of his student leadership cohort (see the general history of NYU contained within the collection). </p><p> In his collected correspondence Mason also attributed a portion of his political views to his experiences in Paris, France, which he visited in 1968 in the aftermath of the "Paris Commune" and the national students' strike, which strongly affected French educational policy through the mid-1970's. </p><p> After his involvement with NYU and the student movement as an undergraduate, Mason went on to get a M.A. from NYU's Politics Department and then a Ph.D. from CUNY. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Contents</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The John G. Mason Papers are a personal collection of records that document NYU student activity and the student movement. The collection is the result of selective recordkeeping on the part of the collection's creator and donor. Mason was an active or ex-officio member of many of NYU's student organizations during the late 1960s. As a result, several students and faculty members entrusted him with their materials regarding this period. The collection covers the period 1962-1978, although the bulk of the materials are concentrated upon the period from 1965 through 1971. It is also important to note that while there are some materials from the University Heights campus in the collection, the bulk of the material is from the Washington Square campus. </p><p> The primary collection materials include: leaflets, organizational position papers, flyers, posters, handbills, public-relations pamphlets, university and student publications, newsletters, newspapers, analytical, financial, and strategic documents, and multiple analyses of the university's structure, officers, trustees, financial activity, professoriate, and curriculum. The collection also includes ephemera such as buttons and organizational membership cards. Included as well is 16mm film footage of a student and faculty protest against Dow Chemical Corporation recruiters on campus. This footage was filmed by NYU Campus Security. These materials exist as manuscript, typescript, mimeographic reproduction, printed matter and freehand drawings. </p>
