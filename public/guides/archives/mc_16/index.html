  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Biography of Elmer Ellsworth Brown</h3>
  <div>
      <p> Elmer Ellsworth Brown (1861-1934), educator and university administrator, was born in Kiantone, Chautaugua County, New York, on August 26, 1861. He was the fourth and youngest child of Russell McCrary and Electa Louisa (Sherman) Brown. His father's ancestors had moved from Connecticut to Albany County, New York, in the early eighteenth century and had settled in western New York around 1800. In 1862 the family moved west to Sublette, Illinois, but returned shortly thereafter to Kiantone, when Elmer's father enlisted in the Union Army. In 1864 the family returned to Sublette following Russell Brown's discharge from the Army due to poor health. </p><p> The Brown family lived in virtual poverty. Their farmland on the Illinois prairie produced only enough for family consumption. Additional income was received through a small soldier's pension and money earned by the children in performing neighborhood chores. Russell Brown, the grandson of a Congregational minister, completed his formal schooling in New York State and yearned for a college education, but financial conditions forced him to turn toward farming. He compensated for his lack of formal collegiate instruction by immersing himself in literature and poetry, an interest in which he imparted to his children. His suppressed desire for higher learning was to be manifested and fulfilled in all four of his children, each of whom were to acquire a college education and enter into professional careers. </p><p> Elmer Brown did not begin formal schooling until he was eight years old. A precocious and energetic child, he proved to be a serious student. In 1874, while attending Sublette High School, Brown competed with students for teacher certification and finished first in the county examinations. His youth, however, precluded his appointment as a teacher. Two years later, he entered the State Normal University and soon began a period of both teaching and study in Illinois. </p><p> In 1878 Brown became principal of the public schools in Rockport, and in 1880 he served as a teacher in the public schools in Astoria. In 1881 he graduated from Illinois State Normal University and became principal of public schools in Belvidere, serving there until 1884, when family financial circumstances forced him away from education. His older brother, Isaac Eddy Brown, held the position of State Secretary of the Illinois Y.M.C.A., and Elmer became Assistant Secretary, a position in which he occupied until 1887, when he had earned enough money to continue his college education. </p><p> In the fall of 1887, Brown entered the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to study the theory and practice of education under Professor William H. Payne, and the history and philosophy of education under Professor Burke A. Hinsdale. His Normal School preparation had provided him with advanced standing so that he was able to complete the four-year course in two years, graduating in June 1889 with Phi Beta Kappa honors. Two days following commencement, Brown was married to his cousin Fanny F. Eddy of Detroit. Fanny was the daughter of the Reverend Zachery Eddy, a prominent Michigan clergyman. </p><p> Elmer and Fanny Brown traveled to Europe in 1889 and settled in Germany, where Elmer enrolled in the University of Halle-Wittenberg to study the philosophy of education. At the end of the academic year, he was awarded the Ph.D. degree, completing and publishing his German-language thesis, "The Position of States Toward the Church and Carrying Out Religious Education in the Schools in Prussia, England, and the United States" (1890). Returning to the United States, Brown became a high school principal in Jackson, Michigan, a position he held until 1891, when he was selected as acting Assistant Professor of the Art and Science of Teaching in the University of Michigan, temporarily replacing his mentor, Dr. Hinsdale. Before his first year was completed, he received an invitation to join the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley. </p><p> Brown spent the next fourteen years at Berkeley. He was appointed to as the first chair of the Science and Art of Teaching in 1892, and he soon formulated plans for the organization and development of the University's Department of Pedagogy. During his tenure at the University of California, he wrote his best known scholarly works, <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Origins of American State Universities</span> (1903), and <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">The Making of Our Middle Schools</span> (1903), a historical study of secondary education in the United States. Through his publications and his work in developing the pedagogy department at Berkeley, Brown became a national figure in education. In 1905 he was elected to serve a two-year term as president of the National Council on Education. </p><p> In 1906 Elmer Brown was appointed United States Commissioner of Education by President Theodore Roosevelt. Building upon the work of his predecessor, William Torrey Harris, he succeeded in enlarging the Bureau of Education by establishing special divisions in higher education and school administration, as well as by extending the services of the Bureau throughout the country. As national spokesman for education, Brown traveled extensively, addressing the myriad problems and issues in elementary, secondary, and higher education. A selection of his many speeches and essays were published in <span class="ead-emph ead-emph-italic">Government By Influence and Other Addresses</span> (1910). He was reappointed to the position by William Howard Taft in 1908, and served until 1911, when he was chosen to be Chancellor of New York University. He held that office until 1933, and the title of Chancellor Emeritus until his death in New York City on November 3, 1934. </p><p> Sources: </p><p> Frusciano, Thomas J.
