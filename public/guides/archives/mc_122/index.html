    <p>Carroll Newsom was a businessman and scholar who was President of NYU from 1956-1962. The papers include Newsom's addresses, especially those given while at NYU and during the 1960's in general, publications by Newsom in journals and periodicals from 1940-1973, publications about Newsom relating to his role on advisory committes (e.g., curriculum survey of the New York State University system), programs which document the various functions he attended, miscellaneous materials (correspondence, reviews of Newsom's books, and diplomas), and newspapers and newspaper clippings relating to important events in his career.</p></div>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Historical/Biographical Note:</h3>
  <div>
      <p> <span class="ead-persname">Carroll Newsom</span>'s illustrious career, amply showcased in a resume which lists 52 major positions, 37 "minor positions," 9 published books and 24 honorary degrees (in addition to three earned degrees), is only partially illuminated by the materials contained in this collection. Nonetheless, the Newsom papers offer a glimpse of his career beyond his position as President of <span class="ead-corpname">New York University</span>, and are of particular value in contributing to a knowledge of the ideas, philosophy, and achievements of this hybrid businessman-scholar. </p><p> Carroll Newsom graduated from the <span class="ead-corpname">College of Emporia</span>, <span class="ead-geogname">Kansas</span> in <span class="ead-date">1924</span>, receiving his A.B. degree in mathematics. A prodigy in mathematics, Newsom became an instructor of mathematics at the <span class="ead-corpname">University of Michigan</span> in <span class="ead-date">1927</span>, the institution from which he received his M.A. in <span class="ead-date">1927</span> and PhD. in <span class="ead-date">1931</span>. His achievements at this university anticipate his later career. Reworking the traditional mathematics curriculum of the university, which Newsom characterized simply as being "bad," Newsom had become a full professor and department chairman in the astonishingly short space of five years. </p><p> During the Second World War, and the consequent increased demand for mathematicians and scientists, Newsom took a position as Chairman of the Science Division at <span class="ead-corpname">Oberlin College</span>. Newsom had already written about both the positive and negative potential of atomic energy(in An American Philosophy of Education). During one meeting with a nervous President Truman, Newsom advised the new President to continue with the <span class="ead-subject">Manhattan Project</span>, after Truman had asked him, "Do you think this is something I should pursue?" </p><p> At the war's end, Newsom and two other American doctors helped to reorganize medical education in <span class="ead-geogname">France</span>, for which Newsom was later awarded the French Legion of Honor. Taking leave of <span class="ead-corpname">Oberlin</span> in <span class="ead-date">1948</span>, Newsom moved on to <span class="ead-geogname">New York</span>, where he took the post of <span class="ead-occupation">Assistant Commissioner of Higher Education</span> in <span class="ead-date">1948</span>. As Associate Commissioner from <span class="ead-date">1950 to 1955</span>, Newsom was instrumental in developing the state university system. </p><p> Newsom's last stop on the educational trail was at <span class="ead-corpname">New York University</span>, first as <span class="ead-occupation">Executive Vice President</span> from <span class="ead-date">1955 to 1956</span>, then as President from <span class="ead-date">1956 to 1962</span> (his resignation took effect on <span class="ead-date">January 1, 1962</span>). His tenure as <span class="ead-occupation">NYU President</span> was considered by the university trustees to be "the most fruitful in the university's history, in the increase of financial resources and in building expansion." During his presidency, <span class="ead-corpname">NYU's</span> assets increased from $111 million to $178 million, a total of $70 million in gifts having been received during his tenure as President. </p><p> Newsom moved on to the Senior Vice President slot at <span class="ead-corpname">Prentice-Hall</span>, becoming president and director of the publishing firm in <span class="ead-date">1964</span>. Yet once again, Newsom's brief tenure at <span class="ead-corpname">Prentice-Hall</span> resembled that of a corporate raider, as he left the presidency of the firm in <span class="ead-date">1965</span>, only one year after having taken the position. Actually, he resignation was partially prompted by the failure of RCA (of which Newsom was a Director) in its attempt to merge with <span class="ead-corpname">Prentice-Hall</span>. For the next three years( <span class="ead-date">1966 to 1969</span>), Newsom held the post of <span class="ead-occupation">vice-president for education at RCA</span>, a position which permitted further work in one of Newsom's special fields of interest, that of educational television. </p><p> The brevity of Newsom's tenure at various corporate institutions can be attributed in part to the multiplicity of his interests. As already mentioned, one of his foremost concerns was the educational potential of television, which Newsom glimpsed at the very germination of the new medium in the early <span class="ead-date">1950's</span>. His ideas were set forth in a landmark text on the subject, <span class="ead-subject">A Television Policy for Education</span> (<span class="ead-date">1952</span>), which held its own for at least two decades as a authoritative source of information on <span class="ead-subject">education television policy</span>. Newsom's other interests include <span class="ead-subject">religious history</span>(one of his later books, <span class="ead-title"><span class="ead-emph ead-emph-underline">The Roots of Christianity</span> </span>, was deemed "a truly great book" by Normal Vincent Peale), <span class="ead-subject">third-world dilemmas</span> (he served as President of <span class="ead-corpname">American Friends of Ethiopia</span>), and, of course, his starting point, mathematics. </p>
