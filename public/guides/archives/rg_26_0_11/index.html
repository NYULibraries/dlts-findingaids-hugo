  <div>
      <p> Dr. Louis Kleinman graduated from NYU with a bachelor of Science in 1948. He received a Master of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1949 and returned to NYU to earn his doctorate in education, which he received in 1959. Prior to earning his doctorate, he joined the staff at NYU in 1952 as Director of Educational Placement Services. From 1955 to 1960 he served as director of the Camden division of Rutgers University's School of Education. Kleinman returned to NYU in 1960, becoming head of the Teacher Education Section of NYU's Experimental Teaching Center. In 1961 he became head of the School's Center for Field Research and School Services. Kleinman retained this position when, in 1967, he was named to the new post of Associate Dean for Research, Field and Administrative Services. </p>

  <h3 class="formattednote-header">Scope and Content</h3>
  <div>
      <p> The Records of the Office of the Associate Dean of the School of Education spans 1962 to 1970, with most materials falling between 1967 and 1969. It is divided into three series: Series I: Departmental Administrative & Budgetary Memoranda; Series II: General Administrative Records; Series III: School of Education Publications. Series I is arranged alphabetically by department and consists of general correspondence and requests for funding for various projects between department heads and faculty and the Office of the Associate Dean as represented by either Dr. Elliot Mininberg (Director of Administrative Services and Assistant to the Associate Dean) or Associate Dean Kleinman himself. Series II contains a lot of general memoranda including a good deal from the Department of Administration and Supervision. Also included are copies of form letters and requests (both paid and unpaid) for budget allocations for food services and flyer/leaflet/pamphlet publication. Series III contains more correspondence dealing specifically with School of Education publications as well as copies of many of the publications themselves, primarily from 1968 and 1969. </p><p> This collection will be of use to those interested in the history of NYU's School of Education as well as the development of educational programs in the 1960s and 70s. The collection is reflective of the diversity of options available to students interested pursuing a career in education during this era. </p>
