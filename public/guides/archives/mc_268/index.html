      <p> The Fred B. Renwick Papers contain materials that relate to the professional career of Fred Blackwell Renwick, a professor of finance who taught at New York University's Leonard N.

      <p> At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival record cartons, and the original folders of the collection were maintained.
