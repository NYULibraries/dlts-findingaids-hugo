  <div>
      <p> Francis Hovey Stoddard, university educator and administrator, was born on April 25, 1847, in Middlebury, Vermont, the son of Solomon and Francis Elizabeth (Greenwood) Stoddard. Between 1884 and 1886 Stoddard studied English philology at Oxford University, England. In 1869 he earned the A.B. degree from Amherst College. After graduating Stoddard taught in Northampton, Massachusetts, and was later employed in the cotton manufacturing business there. In 1873 he married Lucy Maria Smith of Springfield, Massachusetts. They had one daughter, Lucy. In 1887 he served as Instructor of English at the University of California. In 1888 Stoddard came to New York University and assumed a position in the newly created Department of English Language and Literature. In 1910 Stoddard was appointed Dean of the University College of Arts and Pure Science.  </p><p> In 1896 he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. degree from Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh) and in 1914 an honorary LL.D. degree from New York University. His memberships included the Century Association, the Authors' Club and the American Philological Association. Stoddard retired from New York University in 1914 and died in New York City in 1936. </p><p> Francis Stoddard authored many books, including: <span class="ead-title">The Modern Novel</span> (1883), <span class="ead-title">The ideal in Literature</span> (1884), <span class="ead-title">Psycho-Biography</span> (1885), <span class="ead-title">Women in the English Universities</span> (1886), <span class="ead-title">The Caedmon Poems</span> (1887), <span class="ead-title">Conditions of Labor in England</span> (1887), <span class="ead-title">Miracle Plays and Mysteries</span> (1887), <span class="ead-title">Tolstoi and Matthew Arnold</span> (18?), T<span class="ead-title">he uses of Rhetoric: Introductive Work in College Classes</span> (1890), <span class="ead-title">Literary Spirit in the Colleges</span> (1893), <span class="ead-title">The Study of the English Language</span> (1899), <span class="ead-title">The Introduction to the Works of Lord Byron</span> (1899), <span class="ead-title">The Evolution of the English Novel</span> (1900) and <span class="ead-title">Life and Letters of Charles Butler</span>(1903).

Stoddard developed a high school visitation program with members of the faculty.  </p><p> Although Stoddard's tenure as Dean of University College was relatively short he succeeded in substantially reducing the College deficit, established the honors program, initiated the Summer-Spring academic year and examined the issues of standardizing admission credentials and requirements, student conduct, academic scholarship and grades. </p><p>  Sources:  </p><p> <span class="ead-list"><span class="ead-item">Annual Reports, 1910-1914. <span class="ead-title">Report of the Dean of the College of Arts and Pure Science</span>.</span><span class="ead-item">Chamberlain, Joshua., ed., <span class="ead-title">Universities and Their Sons: New York University</span>.

  <div>
      <p> This collection reflects the administrative functions of the Office of the Dean of the University College of Arts and Pure Science, filled by Stoddard from 1910-1914. There are also some items relating to his years on the University Senate (1896-1914). These papers document issues being debated at colleges and universities across the nation including; the value of standardization of high school credentials, college entrance requirements, of college-level scholarship and of university standards.  </p><p> The papers of Francis Hovey Stoddard have been arranged into three series: General Correspondence, Correspondence (Names), and Subject Files. The documents are arranged within the series either by author, institution, recipient of the correspondence, or by subject. </p><p> Series I contains letters that document the administrative functions of the Office of the Dean of University College. The issues addressed include faculty hiring, M.A. thesis approval, student records and chapel and class attendance. Aside from the general duties of the office, the papers reflect Stoddard's interest in English language and literature, the standardization of high school credentials, and the University's own admissions, transfer, and degree requirements. The series is arranged alphabetically.  </p><p> Series II contains Stoddard's correspondence with University personnel, including Chancellor Elmer Ellsworth Brown, Marshall S. Brown (Dean of the Faculties), and John H. MacCracken (Syndic of the University). </p><p> Series III focuses on topics and issues of interest to Stoddard and to the Office of the Dean. The files contain correspondence with numerous authors represented in each folder. The material is arranged alphabetically, then chronologically within each folder. Of particular interest are files on the Preparatory Schools Committee that document a program in which faculty visited New York high schools to promote New York University and to recruit students. The New York State Department of Education files illustrate initial efforts of New York State to standardize education.  </p>

      <p> The administrative records of Francis Hovey Stoddard, 1904-1915, form part of Record Group 18.0.1, Records of the Office of the Dean, University College of Arts and Pure Science. The papers were presumably deposited in the Treasure Room of Memorial Library on the University Heights campus of New York University along with the files of Archibald L. Bouton, who succeeded Stoddard as dean. The records were subsequently transferred to the Washington Square campus following the sale of the University Heights campus in 1972. In October 1977 the University Archives accessioned both the Stoddard and Bouton papers. </p>
